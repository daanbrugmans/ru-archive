# Text and Multimedia Mining 2023/2024

This repository contains the completed assignments for the Radboud University course [LET-REMA-LCEX06 Text and Multimedia Mining](https://www.ru.nl/courseguides/socsci/courses-osiris/ai/let-rema-lcex06-text-multimedia-mining/) for the school year 2023-2024 as made by [Janneke Nouwen](https://github.com/JannekeNouwen) and [Daan Brugmans](https://github.com/daanbrugmans).
The goal of the assignments is to teach students about different tasks within the domains of Text Mining and Multimedia Mining.
In general, all assignments share the main goal of the course: to extract knowledge from unstructured data.

In total, there are 4 assignments:
- Assignment 1 is an individual assignment where students learn the basics on NLP, such as feature extraction and constructing an NLP pipeline.
- Assignment 2 is a team assignment where students learn to analyze image data, extract features, and train machine learning models on the data.
- Assignment 3 is a team assignment about information extraction, where students attempt to extract date entities from text data, comparing labelling entities by hand and automatic, algorithmic labellers.
- Assignment 4 is a team assignment about authorship attribution, where students learn to extract features from text data that captures the text's author's writing style, in order to attribute an author to a text whose author is unknown.

In addition to the assignments, every student had to perform an individual research project.
However, due to a license agreement related to the dataset analyzed for the project, I cannot share the full source code here.
Instead, I have included just the resulting paper.
