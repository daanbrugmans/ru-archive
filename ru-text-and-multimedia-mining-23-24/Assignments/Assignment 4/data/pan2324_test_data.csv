43,"+Continue+ Summary: While Muraki had Hisoka captured under the light of red moon, what happened to Hisoka remains a mystery. His powers are suddenly on the fritz, memories are coming back to haunt him and Tsuzuki is the only one that can get close to Hisoka. After Tsuzuki rescued me from Muraki""s place, it took almost a three full weeks for me to recover. We haven""t heard from Muraki since then, but I fear the worst is still to come. Ever since I ""recovered"" nothing has been the same for me. Before, I just had the ability to sense others thoughts, but I could control it up to a point. Crowds were harder to control, but I usually made a point to stay away from large gatherings anyways. Now, though, I don""t see myself as the person I used to be. Not quite, at least. Even when I told Tsuzuki I loved him, we have become closer but my fear of people has increased to a point where I even had to take leave from certain assignments because I would end up fainting in the middle of a crowd. I think this is all happening because Muraki wants to control me. He can use me to get to Tsuzuki, we all know that. I don""t know what he did, but I don""t like it. I can sense every one""s feelings now, almost as if they were my own. I can""t seem to get used to it, every day is the same thing. After a time, I thought that maybe, just maybe it would be okay and yet... whatever it is that Muraki is planning, he sure has me like a puppet with strings. Other then live in the library almost full time, Tsuzuki takes me out so I can ""train"" my mind to control it. I have no idea what he was thinking of when he came up with that plan, but seeing as how he""s smarter then he looks I can""t just doubt him yet. Right now I""m on my way to the lake just outside our work building. Cherry trees in full bloom litter their petals along the ground. It""s pretty, but also somewhat eerie at the same time. That is the feeling I get, even when the scenery is so serene. ""Tsuzuki?"" Hisoka called out his partners name, but only silence answered his call. He had gotten to the meeting spot earlier then planned, so he couldn""t really complain about him being late until he was actually late. Hisoka sat down, leaning back leisurely on the grass. He had to lift his hand in surprise as he almost rested it on a smooth, flat rock. He smiled, ""Skipping stones, huh?"" With the flick of his wrist, and the instincts from (at least lately) lots of practice. The stone make seven skips across the lake before it sank with a small ""plunk"". ""I hope you weren""t waiting long, Hisoka."" Tsuzuki said as the sat down on the grass, pulling Hisoka into his arms. ""How have you been holding up? I""m sorry I""ve been so busy lately."" Hisoka huffed, ""Not as busy as the person whom you shoved ALL your paper work to."" ""Ehh? But.. but I have field work to do, and since you weren""t busy...."" Tsuzuki started to panic, his brain hastily trying to come up with some excuse but the look that Hisoka gave Tsuzuki wasn""t one of anger. He slapped his forehead, ""Ah, don""t do that to me. I thought you were seriously mad at me for a while.""",583994
680,"Lunetta looked around with bloodshot eyes, sweaty skin, and batted breath. ""HELP! SOMEONE!"" That voice came again, coming directly from outside, the bartender approached to complain about the beer bottle, but Lunetta had already got up and blitzed from the bar. She slammed the door open on her way out, eyes scanning across the village for any signs of distress. ""ABUELA!"" It was a child, Lunetta sprinted out further into the village down the small incline from the bar, she hopped over a ditch, bare feet covered in wet mud. She followed the sobs and panicked voices, stopping at the opening of the village near the gun store. There Vaas stood, an arm extended out, a gun fitted loosely within his hand, it was held up towards the head of the girl from earlier, the one that had given her back her mother""s necklace. She couldn""t have been no older than Barsul and here Vaas was about to shoot her straight between the eyes as she begged in front of him on her knees. ""Now I am going to tell you one last time, give me back the necklace you little rat!"" Vaas angrily snarled at her, now there were many reasons as to why Lunetta despised Vaas, but she did what she had to. She never thought she would see him again, but he stayed and she wanted to know why, she wanted her necklace back of course, but she wasn""t thinking of that when she left him. She clenched her fists, that click of the hammer being pushed back by the rough skinned thumb of Vaas""s hand snapped her into action. ""Vaas."" She shouted as she ran over to him, he glared at her. ""What the fuck do you want?"" The sudden irritation fading into nothing when her nimble hand reached up to grab his hanging forearm, she caressed tentatively across the glistening skin, feeling the hairs and bulging veins. He suddenly relaxed, all that anger leaving him, when she looked around she saw the many eyes upon them. That one shanty the old woman was at before... She was dead, laying there at the steps with blood draining from a single hole in her head. Lunetta wanted to retract herself from him, but she thought up a more logical response in his presence and instead met his gaze. ""Stop... She is just a kid."" She spoke softly, her voice wavering only slightly, but holding much reason. The hand holding the gun dropped, but instead of holstering the weapon he brought it back up again to where it barely grazed over her chin. ""Nobody bosses me around... You understand?"" She didn""t understand why, but the reason he stated those words were to make it clear that he never gave anyone as many chances as he had to her. Why? ""Yes. I know."" She removed her hand, he gestured towards the girl holstering his weapon. ""Bitch has your necklace."" Vaas mumbled before turning and walking towards the exit of the village. She was more confused on why he was about to leave her, he was about to leave her be and she knew him these past few days to never let anything go. ""Wait."" She said, he paused in his footsteps, only turning slightly. ""What?"" ""Where are you going? Aren""t you going to take me back to your compound?"" ""Why?",6234395
1483,"Virginia - her current foster mother - found the costume at the Salvation Army, and actually took the time to pin it up so it almost fits. She knows she doesn""t look right, since who ever heard of a Snow White with blonde hair, but it""s better than cutting eye holes in a sheet. Virginia and Carl are some of the better foster parents she""s had. They""re not forcing her to take her two younger siblings trick-or-treating, but had instead elected to make her a deal. If she takes Bernie and Jaminda with her, they""ll excuse her from doing chores for three days. Since she hates doing dishes, it""s an easy deal for her to make. Plus the free candy. Lark Tree Lane is a working class neighborhood, but Emma feels safe walking outside at night. The people are friendly, and most of them keep their lights on. She marks the couple houses that don""t, and wonders if the residents are going to wake up to find ""tricks"" have been performed to their trees with toilet paper. She would be tempted to go out to play with the big kids, but her foster parents would notice. She shepherds the kids from house to house, not bothering to hold their hands but keeping an eye on them. She lets Bernie take a pee in Mrs. Schroder""s hedge (there""s no light on so the old lady won""t see it), and keeps repeating assurances that Jaminda makes the cutest kitten ever. Both of the kids are being good, and their bags are filling up in a satisfying fashion. She""s gotten too many sweet tarts and not enough actual chocolate, but she can make the others trade her for them. She""s just about ready to turn around and march them home when they""re cornered by three boys wearing cheap plastic masks, the kind that the school programs warn against for fear of suffocation. She thinks she knows who the one in the Yoda mask is, but she""s not one hundred percent sure. The boys are chuckling in an unpleasant fashion, and she knows what""s about to happen. The bigger kids steal their candy. Emma""s reflexes aren""t quick enough to close her fingers over the fragile Wal-Mart bag, and the one wearing the George H.W. Bush mask gains control of her candy. Later on she""ll realize how stupid it is, but she can""t stand by and let them win. She yells at them to stop and throws herself forward to get back the candy. What happens is predictable to anyone with an ounce of common sense. She is definitely no Wonder Woman, because she can""t take on the three boys on her own. The boys have no manners or never heard the old axiom about how to treat a girl, and it only takes a minute for them to put her down onto the ground. They taunt her about being helpless, and one of them throws his hands up in the air in a faux-pleading mockery. Emma brings Bernie and Jaminda home, and all she has to show for the evening is two crying seven-year-olds and a black eye. She""s already tearing off the costume when she crosses over the threshold, muttering to herself that next year, she""s dressing as Ellen Ripley - or better yet, she""s not dressing up at all. Snow White was a pushover princess, anyway.",1112924
324,"""I""m just as confused by this place as you are by my presence,"" I smiled, careful to show no teeth, ""Come here and see, if you don""t believe me."" And the wolf did, walking over to sniff at my outstretched hand. After a moment of regarding my face and hand with a tilted head, the wolf pushed at my arm with it""s nose and sat down. The weariness was still there in it, but much less so. I took this as a good sign and ran my hand through the fur at it""s back. It looked back up at me for a moment, huffed, and laid down at my feet. I giggled and resumed my patting. It just wanted to be pet. ""How do you like it here, boy?"" I asked. It looked back up me with a look that screamed boredom. When I scratched behind it""s ears, it rested it""s hand against it""s paws. ""Well, I hope it""s a bit better for me than that,"" I smiled sadly, and looked to the side at my reflection in the brook, ""A little scared here... well, a lot scared. Everything is new and it""s only been a day but I-"" The direwolf shot up. I started as it ran off, jumping clear over the brook and to one of the other entrances to the Godswood. A man stood there, staring right at me as the direwolf went to it""s side. As it stared at the man, I could feel happiness. From the direwolf Bronn said the King owned. He wore no crown, so I assumed he was someone close to the King. He was dressed far too well for a guard, though wore a dark gambeson and had a sword at his side. The only thing I could think was ""I""m in so much trouble.' ""Who are you?"" The man asked, looking from me to the wolf, ""Ghost doesn""t usually warm up to people so quickly."" ""I... I am Synne,"" I gulped, using the tree as emotional as well as physical support to lift myself up and brush my dress off, ""Synne, um... Sand."" ""Tyrion mentioned you, his found bastard,"" The man walked deeper into the woods, closer to me. My eyes narrowed, ""Aye, I am a bastard. What of it?"" ""Nothing,"" He said gruffly. As he moved closer, I got a better look at the man. He stood a full head and shoulders taller than me. His hair was very dark blackish color, wild and curly and pushed back from his face by a band at the neck. His eyes shown dark and flashed like obsidian. Both his hair and eyes stood out again his pale skin, skin that was marred with a scar through his eyebrow. He wore no cloak - it was quite warm tonight - but had on a layered gambeson and gorget. He looked more like a man going to battle than a noble. He was also the most breathtakingly handsome man I had ever laid eyes on. I reminded myself what my mother would say; a pretty face means little, it""s the man underneath that counts. He walked to the heart tree in silence, the direwolf - Ghost, the man called him - following behind. When he didn""t speak, I did, ""I""ve never been in a Godswood before, milord. Yet I already find it my favorite place in all King""s Landing."" His eyebrows shot up, surprised by my forwardness, ""Is that so?"" I nodded and turned to the tree, resting a hand on the rough bark, ""I was raised among the sands and woods of Dorne.",748687
2387,"He sat like this for about a minute before he stood up from his seat abruptly, knocking his chair over. He let out a shout and shoved the papers in front of him off the table. He slammed his hands down multiple times, he then turned and ripped the painting off the wall behind his chair. No one made a move as he broke out in a tantrum, throwing the decorum of the conference room. When he finished the room was in shambles and every one of his associates was sinking in their seats. His fists clenched and he stared at them, he took deep ragged breathes and his breathing was all that filled the room. ""Someone get me a fucking gun!"" He yelled and one person on the end ran out of the conference room to appease his request. Or at least get out of there. ""This meeting is over, everyone out before I kill someone!"" The room was cleared before the one who was going to get the gun came back. It was one of Roman""s special pistols, the man ducked when Roman grabbed it and began firing randomly around the room. He ran away as soon as Roman seemed finished, Roman placed the now empty gun onto the table and began to unbutton his white suit jacket. He folded it and placed it down on the table, he paced back and forth, letting out grunts and growls. The phone began ringing again and he snatched it off the table pulling it to his ear. It was Lina. ""I""m on my way."" He tossed the phone halfway across the room and grabbed his jacket on his way to the door. He didn""t look back once. She was sitting on the edge of the hospital bed, mindlessly holding her stomach and staring out the window. It was dark in the room, the only light coming in through the glass and shed by some blue lit lamp on the desk at the corner of the room. The door was opened and Roman came walking in, his jacket still folded and hanging over his forearm. He paused at the door when he saw her and sighed, closing it behind him. The click of the lock on the door caused her to flinch, but she didn""t move. Her arms wrapped firmly around her shoulders and her eyes glistening with fresh tears. Roman threw his jacket onto the bed and sat down beside her, his hands hanging between his legs as he leaned forward on his knees and stared at the floor. She angled her head in his direction and stared at him, her fingers trembling slightly. ""It""s not our fault-"" ""It""s mine."" He interrupted her. ""We shouldn""t have gone along with this if the doctor told me already that it shouldn""t have been possible."" ""I considered it a miracle."" She whispered, her eyes going back to the floor. ""I didn""t realize how much I wanted a family until it was gone."" ""I didn""t realize how much I wanted a family until I married you."" He mumbled and she nibbled on her bottom lip. Her eyes shut and she took a deep breath. ""I told you that if you were going to stay with me you would never have one. A child. Do you regret it?"" He tilted his head to gaze at her and for the first time she knew what his expression was past that mask, what he was. ""No. I can""t see myself with anyone but you.",6234395
1993,"""It was all Brent""s idea to end this whole freakin"" madness because we should respect people from all different nationalities and I""m sure others who felt like they don""t fit in because of their backgrounds and people rejecting them have faced that same thing. If we all join together as one, we""ll have made a difference."" Brutus added. Jojo stood there speechless and also impressed that they""d go this further to promote something like that that has because definitely serious around here recently. He chuckled softly and said, ""That""s actually pretty cool. No one should be rejected because of who they are."" ""Well said, J-Mac."" Marcus said. Jojo seemed to be a little humored about that nickname Marcus gave him and he asked, ""Since when do you call me ""J-Mac""?"" Marcus chuckled at that and he replied, ""Don""t know, man."" Several minutes later, the gang went over to the bulletin board and with 10 pages, lots of people signed this petition and surprisingly...the teachers have signed it as well and Noah was blown away by how Brent""s idea skyrocketed into something amazing. Next thing, the rest of the gang wrote their signatures for Lars"" support and as soon as they were done... ""Is there room for me to sign in?"" Just then, they seek the principal coming in with a pen and Noah graciously allowed him to write the last penmanship of the petition and as soon as he wrote his signature, it""s definitely official. Most of them were amazed with a full amount of support to tackle down the issue of discrimination and the principal said, ""Whomever started this deserves my full support and my regards to this issue."" Brent went forward and he said, ""It was my idea, sir. Lars has been discriminated by several students here and they just made some assumptions to him and his family, thinking that all Mexicans are bad influences and want to go against him and want to kick him out of school. Basically, like taking matters into their own hands."" With each explanation they gave out, the principal became more and more disgusted to hear this and it was especially offensive in a personal level because he""s half mexican as well and to hear that a few students would humiliate Lars and treat him in the most outrageously unfairly way really pissed him off, even though he wouldn""t show his rage. ""Whomever discriminated Lars will be permanently suspended from this school. Do not worry, students. I will make sure that this discriminative behavior ends here."" the principal added. Hours later... As everyone is in class, the principal announced, ""Will Lars Enrique Ramirez please come to my office immediately? Repeat, Lars Enrique Ramirez in my office immediately."" A very nervous Lars got off his seat and left the classroom, but not before someone got up from the seat and just bashed him in the head through the wall, shocking the teacher, but got a lot of cheers from that random student and jeers from Lars, which completely hurt him; both physically and mentally.",1276465
358,"And so, like so many others, he could finally be free to leave. The numbness of my countenance and clinical tone kept the horrors at the edges of my mind - the flashbacks and the images and his words - at bay, but only barely, ""Michael kept me in a cage in the basement of his mansion for a year."" I rolled up the long sleeves of Jaehee""s shirt. I revealed them, the scars I kept covered. Raised bumps, deeper lines, mostly fades away from the wrists until the inside of the elbow, ""I was chained to the bed inside the cage with manacles at my wrists and ankles. The room was soundproofed. I was bathed by Michael daily. I was dressed by Michael. The cage was well kept, ornate even, and everything was... pristine."" I hated it. So damn much. How he could keep my body so healthy and the rooms so clean, but destroyed my soul so thoroughly, ""When he wanted a song, I sang. The basement was professionally soundproofed. Overkill, really, the mansion was on a multiple-acre estate."" ""He beat me often. Cut lines in me, whipped me. Said it was my punishment for leaving, but eventually... I knew the real reason. He enjoyed my pain. It... the sick bastard got off to it."" Keep it clinical, Aya. Keep it monotone. I drew in another deep breath. Zen was silent and unmoving like a statue, ""He raped me daily, sometimes more than once. Sometimes, he would be sweet too. Brought me presents, video games."" I almost told Zen about how Michael stopped that after I tried to hang myself with one of the controller cords. But I didn""t, ""He told me he loved me. But it wasn""t love; it was control."" I skipped over the worst of it. The feel of his slithering fingers, how he would threaten to kill me one moment to planning our honeymoon in Costa Rica the next. But I did tell Zen the worse part. ""I begin to believe him,"" That admission was half whispered, but I felt Zen jerk on the couch. I couldn""t even look his way anymore, focusing on the opposite wall instead, ""After months in that basement, I thought he really did love me. That that was what love was. And that I loved him back. He was so happy when I told him... he strung me up and flogged me to celebrate."" I patted my back over the shoulder, listless, ""I still have those scars too."" There was still more. But I was scared. I still couldn""t look at Zen. This part was the worst. My hand fell to my stomach and the memory of what was once there, ""About four months before I escaped, I got sick. Turns out, I was pregnant. Michael was ecstatic, but I""d never been more afraid. Suddenly, I wasn""t just surviving for myself. I was surviving for the innocent child with half the DNA of a monster. It broke me out of the Stockholm fog I""d started to settle in. I planned for a long time, how to escape. I knew that I needed to before giving birth, or my baby would be born in that hell. And I... was resolved to... to..."" Breathe, Aya. Breathe. ""... to kill myself before the baby was viable if that was the only option."" I was silent for a long moment. I couldn""t even hear Zen""s breathing, ""When I tried a month later, I was of course caught.",748687
3221,"""Do you want some water,"" Eve asked surprisingly kindly, taking Jamila off guard. Jamila slowly nodded cautiously, and Eve pulled the tape off carefully to try and not hurt Jamila. Eve put the canteen up to Jamila""s mouth and Jamila opened and immediately felt the cool liquid run down her throat ridding her off the salty sandy taste. After a few seconds Eve pulled it away and Ardeth took over as he stood above her holding two large metal bracelets or what she thought was bracelets. ""If you promise not to try and attack us, I""ll put these on instead of those bindings, so that you can eat,"" Jamila was about ready to say kiss her ass, but then she heard her stomach lurch suddenly and make a roar. She groaned and nodded. He bent down slowly and put the bracelets on before he undid the bindings. She knew the bracelets were blessed, because as she tried to will the wind to herself the bracelets shocked her. She frowned as Ardeth laughed at her attempt. ""Like I said before, if you""ll be good then you can stay like that. As for your legs they are staying like that,"" he said with a smirk. Jamila rolled her eyes as he handed her a ham sandwich and her own canteen. She immediately went at it and had it done in a matter of seconds along with the water. She was glad that no one looked at her as she did this because she would have been very, very embarrassed. Now that she had finished her food, she started planning her escape and a way out of her bindings. She tried to stand up, but found that the bindings around her legs wouldn""t let her. She sighed in frustration and tried again, and managed to get at least to the hammock that was close to her. As she plopped down it made a squeaky sound making the black guy turn around from the wheel and look at her. He looked her up and down at first and smirked, before he turned back to look at the others. She couldn""t hear him, but she knew he was telling them something about her. She saw Alex look up at her and then look back at Ardeth and say something making Ardeth nod. Alex then began walking toward her and she tried to stand up, but failed and fell back on the hammock making Alex laugh. ""Need help there,"" Alex said tauntingly. ""Nope, do you need help getting your ass kicked? I could help you if you untied my legs,"" Jamila said batting her eyelash innocently, making Alex scoff. ""You couldn""t kick my ass, even if you gave it your best,"" Alex replied with a laugh. Jamila growled out of anger before saying, ""You wanna put that to a test."" Alex shrugged his shoulders and said, ""I would, but you""d lose. Plus Ardeth told me not to untie you, and I don""t disobey orders. Unlike you."" Jamila got a confused look on her face before blurting out, ""What."" ""Back in the museum, you were going to kill my little sister and then you saved her and got hurt in the process. Why,"" Alex asked sitting down on the hammock with her. Jamila stared at him for a moment debating whether to strangle him now that he was in range or tell him. She chose the safest way. She shrugged and said, ""Don""t know really.",806976
594,"Better to leave now while we can... Too late... Zeke had settled himself on the only way that led out of the inn, sitting up like a dog. Irvine and Thomas sat down beside their table, a meter away from their own. Can""t do anything now...might attract attention... Raven just prepared himself in any case, grasping his gun in the pockets of his trouser. Van still continued drinking his java, impervious to the tension around him, his eye still set on Raven. The other pilot knew that Van was looking out for him, one wrong move from any person that meant hurting him and all hell would break loose with the name ""Van"" on the banner. ""So, if we survey the mountain sides for any clues as to where Van might be located; there is a possible chance that he might just turn up..."" Thomas droned on, eyeing a chance where he can use his technical expertise. ""Even so, remember that we are near the Valley of the Rare Hertz. It wouldn""t be nice to bring along our zoids, and I doubt Zeke will follow us through it. ""Irvine commented. ""Which is why we are going on foot, I""ve reserved a room for us here in the inn. We can do a three-day search on the valley with my scanner. ""Thomas said with finality, leaving no room for Irvine to argue. ""Argh! Fine, you got me! But I""m not going there unarmed."" Irvine roused up. ""We have no choice, this locale is located in the boundary of both territories. It is not under the jurisdiction of even the Guardian Force, because technically this is an ""inside"" matter."" Thomas emphasized the quotation on the word. ""We are looking for Van, that is all. If we find a rebel group, we do nothing. That would just mean trouble for us, for both countries, and for this town. I suggest we pass ourselves as tourists in the meantime."" ""Whatever...""Irvine""s gaze tried to shift to another view, just to keep it away from Thomas"" piercing eyes. And it fell upon the strange boy with the nice hair. ""Shit...why is Irvine staring at Van...hope he doesn""t recognize him...""Raven muttered. His heartbeat was still calm, yet his mind was screaming. ""Uhm, Thomas. Aren""t clan markings unique? That there are no others like this in the whole continent but only to one clan?"" Irvine asked the other pilot. ""Yes...why?"" Thomas looked up from the boring tablecloth. ""Look...""Irvine motioned his eyes to prod Thomas to look at the direction he was pointing. True enough; Thomas"" mouth gaped open as he recognized the vague, yet recognizable red mark on the boy""s left cheek. ""You think..."" Thomas whispered discreetly at Irvine. ""Yes, let""s follow em"" later on."" Irvine confirmed the pilot""s thought. And as if to confirm their suspicions, Zeke started sniffing the unsuspecting Van, who didn""t mind the organoid as he continued sipping his java. Raven just kept on drinking, yet his mind was already forming a plan as to how to escape a possible world of mess. After Van had placed his mug down, signifying that he finished his java, Raven led both of them out towards the crowded market streets; by way of Zeke.",583064
1429,"The traditional institutions did not take the internet world very seriously, however, but on the Internet she could play without her face, her identity, or her sex overshadowing the strengths in her moves. Only in the Internet, where all players could be equally anonymous, was she able to shine unhindered by the stigma of her gender. She had chosen a male pseudonym to protect herself, and it wasn""t Akira""s place to confront her. He shook his head, dismissing the hint of pity he felt for his mother""s plight. She was a proud woman, and would not appreciate it. She had found her own way to advance her love for the game, and Akira could respect that. She had found her own rival, the Internet phenomenon SAI, who she played weekly at this time. It was hard not to be envious of her luck in discovering a destine rival, the someone to travel the path to the Hand of God together. Sometimes he thought Hikaru might be that someone meant for him, but Hikaru was unwilling to commit himself wholly to the game. Someday, maybe... but Hikaru""s unwillingness was a factor in Akira""s own reluctance to commit the rest of his life to Go alone. As he watched the players enter the mid-game (both using hauntingly familiar styles that Akira couldn""t admit he recognized as friends""), he forced himself to let himself just focus on the Go. Maybe by watching the beautiful, dazzling game, Akira might discover some of the answers he needed. Despite his reluctance, Akira invited Hikaru to dinner. They were sitting in his father""s Go salon, playing a game as usual. Hikaru had brought an ungodly amount of sweets and spread them out on the table, having learned from experience that Go salons didn""t serve much in the way of food. They""d just finished a game of speed Go (which Akira won by the skin of his teeth) when he decided it was time to ask. ""My mother would like to meet you,"" he said. ""Can you come to dinner on Saturday?"" Hikaru laughed at that. ""Why now?"" It was a good question, since they""d been friends for going on three years. Well, Hikaru would call them friends; it had taken Akira much longer to reconcile himself to that somewhat unbelievable fact. Aside from Go, the two had little in common. ""No idea, but my mother is going to call yours to make arrangements if we don""t set it up ourselves,"" Akira told him. It was embarrassing, but Kouko never concerned herself with teenage dignity. She was an efficient person, taking the direct route with extreme grace and manners. And she always got her way, so there was no fighting it. Hikaru blinked. ""She wants to call my parents? It""s not like you""re asking me out on a date, are you?"" Akira rolled his eyes, before stealing a stick of Hikaru""s pocky. ""I""m not? Because right after you meet my parents, we""re going to have a white wedding and honeymoon in Baghdad."" That provoked a snicker from Hikaru. ""You know, you""re starting to get better with the sarcasm thing. That was almost decent, though your delivery could use more work."" Akira just shook his head, not deigning to reply.",1112924
1898,"She swung her yoyo to shield them from the ammunition coming at them. ""I will have you culinary triumph!"" Calamity hissed! ""I think-!"" Ladybug vaulted from Calamity""s gigantic cream puff. ""NOT!"" She swung her yoyo down at Calamity, who raised her whisk to block and her yoyo wrapped securely around the weapon. ""Chat, dump it on her now!"" Ladybug called. Her partner was quick act, dumping the creme glace on a distracted Calamity. Immediately, the concoction froze the akuma in its tracks. ""Urgh!"" Calamity grunted as she tried to moved. Ladybug smiled at her leather clad partner. She carefully unhooked the necklace from Calamity""s neck. ""It""s time for this to end, my little akuma."" She crushed the necklace in her hands and the black butterfly flew from the ruined vessel. She flicked her yoyo out and caught the evil-ized bug. ""You""ve been a bad little baker, mon petite akuma."" She released the butterfly moments later, smiling as she waved at the pure white fluttering insect. ""Bye bye, papillion."" Calamity""s transformation receded and Colette slumped to the ground, confused and dazed. ""MIRACULOUS LADYBUG!"" The bowl spiraled into the air and dispersed into a red light that busily worked to repair all the damage done. The remains of Calamity""s dessert assault faded as the light rushed over the hotel. ""Bien joue,"" the duo bumped fists. ""Nice plan, M""Lady."" Chat grinned at her. ""I couldn""t have done it without you."" Ladybug smiled at her partner. ""We do bake well together."" Chat waggled his brows and Ladybug rolled her eyes. Her earring thankfully, gave her a sharp warning. ""Looks like my time""s up, kitty. I""m out of this oven before dough hits the fan."" She swung her yoyo up and out, hooking a building fixture to tug herself away. ""Now all I have to do is think of an alibi for Alya..."" the superheroine muttered to herself. ""MARINETTE!"" her best friend tackled the bluenette in a bone crushing hug. ""Are you okay? Did you get zombified? Did you see Ladybug? Did she save you?"" Adrien watched from the doorway of a nearby room he""d ducked into before his transformation gave way and he had a whiny Plagg to deal with, satisfied to see that Mari was safe. Now, he just had to stuff Plagg with cheese and apologize to the designer sometime tonight. ""I""m fine, I""m fine..."" Mari assured her best friend. She didn""t look much worse for wear, the only sign of her ordeal the loss of her small purse. Her pigtails seemed fuller, somewhat, but he chalked that up to humidity. As Alya grilled her friend for more information, the door to the stairs opened and a dazed Colette shuffled out. Adrien studied her. Ladybug""s Miraculous Cure had reformed her necklace and the young woman was fingering it absently as she slowly tried to walk around the group and toward the elevators. Unfortunately for her, Chloe saw her. ""Mon dieu! Get that creep out of here."" Eyes locked onto retreating form of Colette. ""She""ll sauce us again, and try to get her job back. Get her out, get her out, Eli-poo!""",3439302
3098,"""Remember, ask Elle to be Amber in our movie, and give her the script-"" Charles reminded Cary for the hundredth time that morning. ""I know, Charles. Jeez."" ""Whatever. Good luck anyway."" Charles left him standing in front of Mr. Dunn""s door. Shaking his head, Cary went inside. The room was alive with chatter, which was surprising, because usually everyone was half-asleep in the morning. He caught sight of Elle, and his stomach gave a little lurch. What was that? He shook his head vigorously, trying to clear his mind. For God""s sake, you""re just asking her if she can act. Stop wigging. Cary dropped his bag in his chair and sifted through it, searching for the script. ""Dammit."" He pulled out crumpled bits of paper, rubber band balls, a used firecracker, homework he""d never turned in- ""The Sea of Decay,"" someone said behind him. Cary nearly jumped out of his skin and swiveled around to see Elle, grinning at him. ""Oh, it""s you,"" he said. ""What""s that supposed to mean?"" ""Nothing. Sit."" He patted the desk next to him. ""So- er- I was wondering- can you act?"" He deliberately buried his face in his bag so he wouldn""t have to look at her. ""No idea. I""ve never tried it. Why?"" ""Well, one of my friends, Charles- he""s this guy who likes making movies- he needs a girl for one of the roles, so... like... yeah."" he finished lamely. ""Oh, here it is, damn thing- anyway, read this for me."" He held up a paper bearing a scene Charles had hastily scrawled out. ""What""s this?"" she flipped through it. ""Script,"" Cary grunted. ""Start from the highlighted lines on the first page. I""ll do Lex for you."" ""Alright... ahem... ""I don""t know, Lex, I just feel something... something different for Rob. It""s been out of control. Yesterday he smiled at me and I don""t know... my heart sped up, I broke out in a sweat, and I suddenly felt faint.'"" Elle""s voice was soft and heartfelt, and Cary found himself believing her. """"It""s weird... I""ve known him for years, why is this happening now? Lex I... I think I""m in love with him!'"" She looked expectantly at Cary, who had been sitting there and staring at her like a dumbass for the past minute. ""Oh, sorry.. uh.. ""No way, Amber. You say that about every guy you meet,'"" he read flatly. """"No, this is different, Lex. I feel like it""s meant to be. I really do. It""s like... fireworks.'"" She sat back, a critical expression on her face. ""Was that okay?"" ""Okay? Okay? That- that was-"" he couldn""t even find the words. ""Dude, Charles is gonna love you."" ""Charles, get your fat ass out here! I didn""t wake up at five on a Saturday for this crap!"" Cary""s shrill voice broke the early morning silence. ""I""m coming, I""m coming, just hold on-"" Charles"" reply crackled through the walkie-talkie. ""You said that ten minutes ago!"" Cary whined. ""Keep your shit together for a few minutes, I""m coming-"" ""You said that ten minutes ago, too! What""re ya doing, Charles, putting on your makeup? Let""s go, let""s go, we""re gonna miss the sunrise!"" ""Shithead, it takes a while to bike to Lookout Hill when you""ve got a camera, a tripod, and a mic on your back!"" ""Why me?""",2855986
2784,"He turns around and sees Gylfie and Soren come in and said, ""Hi."" ""What you did back there was amazing. I wish I could""ve done it before."" Soren said. ""You did, Soren. Remember?"" asked Gylfie. ""Yes, I do. Just wished I could""ve done it better than Travis without trying too hard."" ""This is just new to me for a while. It""s just...gonna take some time to get used to it, but I like it here."" ""I understand. Although, I do have to admit, you did ten times better."" ""You think so?"" ""For anyone that runs away from St. Aggie""s, I""d say you""ve done well. Did anyone find out?"" asked Gylfie. ""Actually, they didn""t know I ran away from St. Aggie""s until some of the tytos followed me."" ""That""s terrible."" ""My fear is that they""ll find me and drag me back to St. Aggie""s. I really don;t wanna go through that again."" ""And you won""t, not when you""re with us."" Soren said. ""You mean that?"" ""Yes, we do."" ""Thanks."" Back at St. Aggie""s, Kludd looms over the skies, looking at the pickers as well as the tytos at the same time. Nyra comes in from behind and asked, ""Did anyone find Travis?"" ""They have."" ""And?"" ""No sign. It""s been 3 weeks since he left."" ""No matter. We will bring him back."" ""And when we do, I will teach him a lesson about flying away from here."" ""You""re gonna kill him?"" ""I""m gonna find where he is and grab him with my sharp talons and take him down...and then I""ll kill him."" Nyra chuckled evilly and said, ""Have I ever mentioned you being here became so wonderful."" ""Yes it is."" Kludd looks up at the sky and said, ""Travis, I hope you enjoy your freedom, because it""ll be the last day you""ll get that freedom."" Oh, boy! This is where it""s getting scary! Stay tuned for more of this awesome story! Sorry it took so long and I""m gonna update this entire story! Chapter 7: New Gift The next day, Travis starts flying all around Ga""hoole to see what it looks like and from the looks of it, it looks as if this is new home now. He chuckled softly and then goes up towards the air and lands towards the Great Tree. He walks there and sees Soren and some other little owls telling a story. Gylfie recognizes him coming over and quietly walks in and asked, ""Did you want to come in?"" ""Well, I""m still testing my wings out. Plus, I just felt like flying, so."" ""You can come inside if you want. Soren""s telling an amazing story."" ""Is that right?"" ""Yes."" ""Well, okay."" They both come in as Soren tells them the rest of the story and this is the first time that Travis can see this. ""And then, Kludd was gonna fight me, but I tried to convince him that the Guardians were real, but he still wanted to fight me, so we were in this tree and Kludd tried to grab my wing, but the branch fell off as we were getting closer to the fire. Kludd couldn""t hold on much longer, so I tried to save him, but he tried to pull me into the fire! But it didn""t work as he fell to the fire instead. It was the most shocking thing ever, so I took a piece of the burning branch and flew off to save Ezylryb from Metalbeak and I defeated him with this burning branch.""",1276465
1417,"Surely, he wasn""t expecting this witch to really tell his mother about his so-called girlfriend! What will he do?! Think Kikuchi! Think! Excuses, excuses, where art though?! Mrs. Kikuchi""s jaw dropped. She was speechless. What the heck.. What will his mother think?! That he was not concentrating in his studies? ""Yoshito...?"" Rhine secretly savored the moment. It seems Mrs. Kikuchi didn""t know about her son""s girlfriend. She definitely was enjoying the scene though it would really be fun if Yoshito showed some emotion, not just standing there, a blank expression on his face. ""You mean..."" Mrs. Kikuchi studied her son. Yoshito clenched and unclenched his fists. If there was one person besides Onizuka and Kanzaki who could make him feel nervous under his/her gaze, that would be his mother. She directed her gaze back to Rhine. ""You mean... my son actually had the guts to court a girl?"" Kikuchi couldn""t believe his ears. Was his mother.... joking? Disappointment was plastered across Rhine""s face. ""Aren""t you mad at your son, auntie, for having a girlfriend without your consent?"" Mrs. Kikuchi smiled mischievously. ""Of course I""m jealous that I""m the last to know that my son already has a girlfriend,"" she shot an eyebrow at Yoshito, ""BUT! That is the least of my worries!"" She laughed. ""I mean, I really can""t believe that my son actually had time for girls!"" Kikuchi shook his head. Mental note to self: check if it is full moon, people sure are lunatic today. ""B-but,"" Rhine was speechless. ""Don""t worry! My son is responsible enough not to make his girlfriend cry."" ""B-but..."" Takeshi checked his watch. ""I think we need to go home now, Rhine,"" ""But it is still early. Why don""t you just stay here for the night?"" Mrs. Kikuchi offered. ""I""m sorry, madam, we really are. But you see, we need to go to school early tomorrow,"" Takeshi explained. ""School? You mean, you are planning to stay?"" Kikuchi asked curiously. ""Yup! We plan to study high school here!"" Rhine answered happily. She stood up. ""We really need to go now, auntie."" Mrs. Kikuchi smiled sadly. ""Okay, but be sure to come back."" She followed Takeshi and Rhine to the door, dragging her son in the process. ""At least see them off, mister!"" she whispered to a groaning Kikuchi. ""It is really nice chatting with you, auntie,"" Rhine said. ""We""ll sure come back."" ""I really hope so,"" Mrs. Kikuchi nudged her son. Yes, we hope you""ll come back,"" Yoshito said dully. Only his comfy bed was in his mind. ""Don""t worry, Yoshito, we""ll see each other soon. Don""t be sad."" Rhine said sweetly. Kikuchi tried to force a smile. Don""t worry, Rhine, he won""t be sad since he doesn""t want to see you soon. Rhine and Takeshi went off to the cold night. ""You didn""t tell me you have a girlfriend, mister,"" Kikuchi heard his mom said after a while. She was grinning ear to ear. When will they let this issue rest? ""Well... I was planning to tell you,"" he lied. ""Oh, so you think you were so great that you don""t need your mother""s advice on girls?"" her mother pouted. ""It""s not that..."" ""Anyway, who is this lucky girl?""",560480

Instantly, Heavy""s eyes bulge with anger as she realizes that she""s been prank called. She turns to speak to the mysterious lady on the phone. ""Why you crack sniffing, ass licking, cock sucking slob; when I find you I""m going to dig the Christmas lights out of my attic and use them to light your cunt on fire! You hear me, bitch!? I""m going to make you pick which members of your family I kill first!"" On the phone the prank caller wittily retorts, ""Fuck you, fatso; you couldn""t fight anything that isn""t deep fried."" At that, Heavy freaks out, screaming and throwing her phone across the room and actually taking a big bite out of the ammo crate she""s sitting on. When she finally calms down, Heavy spits out a mouthful of nails and wood before glaring at the camera. ""This interview is over; you edit all that shit out, you hear me?"" The Heavy then picks up her gun, ""If you""ll excuse me, Ms. Redwina Mann is paying me to kill people and it""s been almost half an hour since I murdered anyone."" Cut to a sterile concrete room with a timer counting down. Over the loudspeakers, a baritone Tony Jay style voice informs the female mercenaries. ""Battle Commences in thirty seconds.

And when I do, if you""re there; I hope to god that you just start walking the other way because it""s not going to be pretty.""

266,"When Kikyo got back up, she yelled, ""Run Keade, NOW!"" The girl ran for the village while Kikyo got her arrow. Meanwhile, the half demon had distracted the panther and was going against it with his bare hands. He leaped away from it""s attempt to tear out his neck. But then, in mid duck, the panther reached it""s huge claws up and scratched the half breed in the chest. He screamed with pain and then put his hand to the cuts. He drenched his hand in his own blood, and yelled, ""Blades Of Blood!"" making red blades slash at the panther. This took it""s tail and it""s horn, but it was still going. It was then that Kikyo got her arrow and made the shot. She hit it in where the skull met the neck. It roared, then collapsed to the ground. Kikyo stood, out of breath, and looked at the half breed. He was just as tired...and still bleeding. At that moment, Kikyo felt pity. ""You are injured,"" she said, taking a step towards him. He stepped back ""It""s just a scratch,"" he said. ""You saved my little sister,"" she said, mystified. ""Returnin a favor."" he said gruffly. Then, he ran into the forest. Kikyo stood there, looking back into the trees for a long time. Then, she heard men from the village coming, and her sister""s voice calling her. Kikyo got her mind cleared, and got ready to haul the carcass to the dry well. Several days passed. Kikyo carried a parcel of vegetables from the shrine""s garden on her arm. She went to the edge of the forest. She looked around. He should have been here. Then she heard the rustle in the leaves over head. He was there. Looking down at her. ""What do you want?"" he asked her suspiciously. ""I want to thank you for saving me and my sister"" she said. ""What""s all that food for?"" he asked, still not convinced that she meant no harm. ""For lunch,"" she said, ""I have enough to share, if you""d like?"" ""Is this some kind of trick, cause I ain""t buyin it,"" he said. ""It is no trick."" she replied, sitting down and spreading out the scarf and food. ""Please,"" she asked. ""Join me."" He stared at her for a few minutes more before he came down. He sat on his haunches, and even as he ate, he kept looking at her, expecting her to pull a trap any moment. ""You do not trust me, correct?"" she asked him as she ate a pear. ""Darn right,"" he said, ""This ain""t poisoned or nothin, is it?"" he asked as he eyed the carrot warily. ""No, it isn""t"" she laughed. ""I only want to thank you."" after a few minutes of silent eating, she said, ""My name is Kikyo, if you wish to know."" ""I already know,"" he mumbled. ""What is your name?"" she asked. He said nothing. They sat silent again for a long time. Then, when they were finished, she gathered the scarf and said, ""I must return to the shrine. Farewell."" As she walked away, she heard him say, ""Inu-yasha."" ""What?"" she asked, turning her head to look at him again. ""My name,"" he said, ""Is Inu-yasha."" Then, he got up and ran into the forest again. Ch 6 Forget My Fate Their meetings went much like that for a while. They would meet for lunch under the tree in the forest.",512464
794,"""Gretchen? What are you doing here this early?"" Gale""s voice was scratchy and had a tint of aggravation in it. ""Sorry Gale but I came to see Dawson, is he still asleep?"" Gale yawned loudly and ushered Gretchen in the house. ""I think so but go on upstairs and wake him up, he needs to wake up anyways"" Gretchen smiled and walked up the stairs to Dawson""s bedroom not aware of what she was going to see next. ""Dawson are you aw-"" Gretchen stopped mid-sentence at what she saw; Joey laying on Dawson""s bed, his arm around her body with a content look on his face. ""Dawson?"" Dawson groaned as he fluttered his eyes open; Dawson looked at who he was lying next to and then he turned to see Gretchen. ""Gretchen this isn""t what it looks like"" Dawson nudged Joey awake; Joey fluttered her brown eyes open to see that she was still at Dawson""s but then she turned her head to see Gretchen who had a look of pain and anger mixed together painted on her face. ""Then what is it Dawson? You guys decided to have a sleep-over?"" Joey pushed herself up and grabbed her backpack. ""I""m going to go bye Dawson"" Dawson got up as well and the next words that came out of his mouth were totally unexpected. ""Wait Jo, don""t go"" Gretchen staggered back and felt tears well up in her eyes when she saw the look Dawson was giving Joey. Pacey was right, she was right... there were some feelings left between them. ""Yeah don""t go, I will"" Dawson turned around to see Gretchen run out, he turned to Joey. ""I""ll be right back... Gretchen!"" Dawson ran out of his room and ran after Gretchen. ""Gretchen please wait!"" Dawson grabbed Gretchen""s arm when he reached her outside, he forced Gretchen to face him. ""I""m-"" ""Sorry? Is that what you ran after to say to me?"" Dawson shook his head. ""Nothing happened. She came over and we fell asleep watching movies, that""s all. Joey and me are over. She is with Pacey now"" ""But if she wasn""t would you be here with me now?"" Dawson opened his mouth to say something but he stopped; he didn""t know what to say. He would be lying if he said he still didn""t love Joey, he had loved Joey in one way or another ever since he was a little boy and not loving Joey didn""t seem possible. He thought he had lost her forever when she left Capeside with Pacey and then Gretchen entered his life and they both went their own ways occasionally saying hi and having a short conversation before one of them would excuse themselves but now here they were again and Dawson didn""t know what to say or to think or to do, and that only happened when Joey Potter was near him. ""Well that answers my question Dawson. We both knew that this wouldn""t be forever, the night we decided to be a couple... remember that night? Pacey""s 18th birthday party? Well we told ourselves that we knew this wasn""t forever, that we were both leaving in the end of the year and all that mattered was now; Well now all that matters is now and the feelings you still have for Joey. Maybe you guys didn""t do anything but it doesn""t mean the thoughts weren""t there... the doubts, the feelings, and the outcome. Know what I see Dawson?",29783
2700,"Jack got up pulling Fi up with him... he looked around the room and put his protective arms around Fi walking themselves over to Carey, Clu and Annie. ""Whoa what in the world is that?"" Clu shook his head in confusion to Annie""s question. Carey used a chair for support against his shaking knees. ""I know what that was"" Everyone turned to Fi. ""What was it Fi? We are waiting for an explanation"" Fi turned to Annie and smiled at her. ""Okay... now before anyone says anything... I got a story for you."" Jack opened his mouth to protest but Carey motioned for him to listen. Annie, Carey, Clu and Jack sat down on the ground meanwhile Fi sat down in the chair in front of her... she scanned the papers and put them down. ""Okay the story I have to tell you takes place in the past. The year was 1930... it revolves around a young boy named Daniel McMann. Daniel lived in this actual house. Daniel wasn""t popular but he wasn""t unpopular... he was unknown to the town of Hope Springs. Daniel didn""t really have friends but he didn""t really have enemies either... he was a sweet boy and was nice to anyone and everyone. Well one day in school... Hope springs high.... Daniel was sitting down at the cafeteria table eating his usual ham and cheese sandwich enjoying his lunch not bothering anyone when two popular kids David Phillips and Clark Bell walked over to Daniel and poured milk all over him for no reason at all. All the kids in the school broke out in laughter.... Except one girl.... Stephanie Thielen... she was dating David Phillips.... She wasn""t laughing because she did not find what they were doing to Daniel funny. Daniel grabbed his books and ran.... He ran as fast as he could... not looking back. He staggered back to his home trying to breathe but he felt as if he was being choked... Daniel ran into his house and collapsed onto the living room floor... where you are sitting now. See there was something that Clark, David and even Stephanie didn""t know... Daniel was allergic to milk and if he came in contact with milk the results could be deadly. So lying on the floor Daniel felt his body go weak... bumps appeared on his face and his breathing stopped.... Because of David and Clark""s little prank Daniel lost his life... in this same house and David and Clark were never caught because Stephanie Thielen, the only one who could bring justice to the town of Hope Springs for Daniel covered for them"" Annie, Carey, Clu and Jack stared at Fi in silence. ""And I think because he was wronged and died before his time his spirit has lived on to torment the people who did this to him... trying to right a wrong. Carey asked me how we were a part of this.... David, Clark, and Stephanie were our great great grandparents"" Again Carey, Clu, Jack and Annie stared at Fi in silence. Annie got up messing with her hair. ""So you""re saying our ancestors wronged Daniel McMann and now we are paying for it? Because they did a bad we are gonna die?"" Fi shook her head. ""Not necessarily.",29783
1070,"""I am the Duchess of Mandalore and I serve my people. If you wish my death, so be it; I""m yours."" For the first time, her gaze dropped from the man""s face, and her head bowed slightly, as much as the knife would allow. ""But death only brings more death. Mandalore will never be allowed to heal as long as we meet each other with violence."" She looked up at the man once more. ""Make your choice."" Frantically, Obi-Wan, reached out to feel the man""s emotions, to get some sense of what he would do, but all the padawan found was a fierce storm of inner turmoil. No one moved-the entire crowd seemed to hold its breath. The man""s hand began to shake. Still nothing. Seconds dragged into minutes. Satine refused to blink-her eyes never left the man""s. ""Oh, for Force""s sake, Dreig""r, drop the knife!"" The tension was shattered by a voice in the crowd. A familiar voice. Obi-Wan looked up and saw the old woman who had sold them supplies pushing her way through the throng of people. In a moment, she had reached the man (Dreig""r, Obi-wan supposed), and jerked the short blade out of his hand. ""If there is more death, it won""t be at our hands. Here you go, dear."" She handed the knife back to Satine, who gripped it loosely, staring at the old woman in confusion. The woman patted the Duchess""s cheek lightly. ""No need to look so surprised, dear."" She leaned in and whispered in Satine""s ear, ""Ke barjurir gar""ade, jagyc""ade kot""la a dalyc""ade kotla""shya,"" and gave her a conspiratorial wink. Satine snorted, her free hand flying up to cover her mouth. ""Gar serim,"" she responded quietly. ""Take your Jetii and go in peace. We will not reveal your location to those who hunt you."" She paused. ""Isn""t that right, Dreig""r?"" she added, elbowing the man playfully in the ribs. Dreig""r bowed his head and mumbled something incomprehensible. ""What was that?"" the old woman asked. Grudgingly, the man looked up. ""You need not fear us, Duchess."" He ground out the words. Satine grabbed his hand. ""Vor entye. Thank you."" He looked surprised, but nodded his acknowledgement. The crowd parted, and Obi-Wan and Satine quickly made their way to the gate. Right before they exited, Satine turned back to the crowd. ""Ret""urcye mhi."" The old woman nodded her head. ""Ret""urcye mhi, Duchess. Be safe."" With that, she Obi-Wan ducked out of the town and headed back into the deserts of Mandalore. ""This is yours, I believe,"" Satine said, coming to sit beside Obi-Wan on a large boulder. The sun was just beginning to creep over the horizon. The first few rays of dawn colored the night sky. After they had returned to camp and related the what had happened to Qui Gon, the Jedi master had decided it best for them to leave immediately, regardless of the villagers"" promise. They had traveled most of the night, finally stopping on a rocky hillock a number of miles to the east of the town in order to get some rest. Obi-Wan looked down and saw his knife proffered in the Duchess""s hand. ""You should still be sleeping,"" he said. They had stopped barely three hours previously. ""So should you,"" she pointed out, smiling.",2943978
3428,"These men are thirsty!"" Ale was passed around generously as men laughed and congratulated their victory to one another. ""Remember today, little brother. Today, life is good."" Boromir lifted his flask to Faramir and nodded. They sipped from their cups, but Boromir had nearly choked cutting himself short. Ale running down his short beard. ""Need I not forget the man that saved me, may he still be alive. Where might he be?!"" Boromir bellowed out happily, Faramir placing a hand to his shoulder and laughing. Out of the crowd came that puny soldier that had had his back for that one moment he needed it. His helmet still hung over his head and the metal loose from the exhaustion that was obvious in his footing. Boromir rose his drink to the man. ""Take off your helmet brother. I wish to share a drink with thee."" So the man had reached up to remove his helmet and when he had, long locks of sun kissed hair fell from its place. The men dropped dead to silence, not one word was spoken and not one smile was shown. Boromir stared into the eyes of his lover, her hair still beautiful, but skin covered with dirt and a few cuts here and there. The cup he held fell from his fingers and made a thump against the ground, she smiled politely at him despite the situation. He was dumbfounded. ""K-Kie..."" He couldn""t finish it, he wouldn""t believe that it was actually her. That she had survived the entire battle as a woman... A soldier. ""Yes, Boromir."" She plainly replied and nodded towards him. He suddenly felt enraged, so angry that she would be foolish enough to go out into battle. ""I wanted to make sure you came home."" ""You insolent...! You could have gotten yourself killed do you not-"" She cut him off with a kiss to the throat, then to the cheek, and then on his lips. She pulled away, his eyes fluttered and he was shocked. ""Just because I""m a woman doesn""t mean I can""t fight. I am just as good as any of these men and I didn""t want to sit back and do nothing."" He immediately dropped to one knee, her eyes grew wide. He grabbed her hand, the helmet thudding to the ground. ""Marry Me. Be my wife."" There was no words spoken for a moment, before she smiled and nodded her head dropping down onto her knees with him to wrap her arms around his neck and the crowd went wild. Kierra stayed in the castle that night to celebrate. She knew little of the conversation Boromir had with his father when he had arrived at the city after the battle. He was to leave in the morning again for Rivendell, so little time together with Kierra made him feel weak. He had still yet to announce their engagement to his father and Boromir was set on giving her the ring that was once his mother""s. After the feast she had left for her room, which he had purposely arranged to be directly across from his. Her parents hadn""t minded that she was staying in castle either, they were ecstatic to hear about the engagement which was so quickly moving along. Boromir knocked upon her chamber-door, the box for the ring held tightly behind his back.",6234395
3033,"The guy was amazingly hot, with midnight black hair, pale blue eyes, and a chiseled face... Yeah, it was unfair how handsome he was. ""Are you injured?"" He frowned. ""Here, let me..."" He picked her up, bridal style. ""Thank you. I""m sure I""m heavy..."" ""Not at all."" Handsome, kind and strong; if he could play violin and cook, Lyra would never let him go. ""Lyra...! Who are you?!"" Ulrich stepped into the room. ""Ricky! Isn""t this a friend of yours; he came out of your cylinder thingies."" Ulrich stiffened then turned to the bespectacled blonde boy- Jeremy. ""A specter?"" ""Highly likely. But he isn""t being hostile..."" ""You both are not far off. I am composed of several specters and a few organic codes gathered from your various visits to Lyoko."" Ulrich frowned and glared at the guy holding her. ""Give me back my sister."" ""She is injured and unable to function her leg properly. Allow me to-"" ""Allow me to throttle you. Give her back!"" Lyra frowned. ""Ricky, he""s just being nice..."" ""He""s a stranger- ever heard of stranger danger?"" ""Ever heard of over protective. Just have him take me upstairs; my first aid kit is still in my backpack, I think. Mom would flip if I didn""t have one with me at all times..."" Ulrich sighed. ""Fine; but he""s still dangerous."" ""And you""re still overreacting."" Ulrich watched as Aelita expertly wrapped Lyra""s ankle out of his peripheral vision. The mystery guy from the scanners- Mr. Specter- sat docile as Jeremy waved a scanner around him. ""Interesting..."" ""What is?"" Ulrich asked. ""He is composed of several specters- but only to fill in the key gaps in his DNA code. He""s pretty much as solid as any of us."" ""And what about the scanner thing? How did he activate a scanner without tripping an alarm."" Jeremy seemed at a loss. ""Well, my theory is that he bypassed the frame codes and-"" ""I say he""s a XANA super-specter!"" Odd exclaimed. Ulrich nodded. ""Makes more sense."" ""Well, then why not attack Aelita or any of us?"" Yumi asked. ""The Hopper specter was pretty docile and even tempered too."" Ulrich pointed out. ""He has to be a specter to be that good looking."" Odd frowned. ""Why is it that all the beautiful people are specters?"" ""I""m not a specter; are you saying I""m not beautiful, Odd?"" Yumi joked. ""That goes for me, too, Odd."" Aelita laughed. ""You""re all bandaged up, Lyra."" ""Thanks, Aelita."" She stood cautiously and tapped her foot tentatively on the ground. ""So who are you, mystery boy?"" Mr. Specter straightened at Lyra""s question. He reddened slightly. ""I am a specter-organic hybrid, able to exist separately from the supercomputer and my father""s influence."" ""Father?"" parroted just about everyone. Specter guy lowered his head. ""Yeah... XANA is my creator... Hence my father. I was created out of XANA""s will to create a backup in case you guys succeeded in eradicating him."" ""Wait, what?"" Lyra said. ""I""m not following, like, any of this. Anyone here speaking human?"" ""Amazing... XANA managed to create a human..."" ""Not human. Barely human. Actually, I""m more remnant of a clone ... Is anyone following?"" Aelita raised her hand.",3439302
63,"""There had to have been-"" Morgan chuckled mirthlessly, ""Reid, you and me both know that there was nothing any of us could have done."" He was right, and I knew it. All I could do was shrug and stare between my fingers at the floor. Time passed by slowly after that; it didn""t do anything to help ease my nerves. Others came and went, but Morgan and I stayed. Eventually Morgan left to confer with the others; I refused to go, preferring to wait for the doctor. Eventually, after what seemed like an eternity, a doctor walked over to me with Morgan in tow. ""I am Dr. Edwards; are you Spencer Reid?"" She asked, looking between Morgan and I. I nodded quickly, ""Yes; I am Spencer Reid. Can I see her?"" ""She was asking for you,"" My heart leapt in my chest at those words. She was alive, ""... won""t say anything other then your name. Come with me; we had to give her a sedative because she had a fit, but she""ll be waking up soon."" I nodded once and she turned, going back the way she came with Morgan and I in tow. ""What""s she got, doc?"" Morgan asked before I could. Edwards sighed and shook her head, ""It was bad. She had so much Dilaudid in her system that we had to treat her for an overdose. We also had to correct a c-section that looked like it had been done with a rusty kitchen knife. Also, only some of her other ""wounds"" were actually wounds at all; she was covered in scars."" ""Did you take pictures and a rape kit for the investigation?"" Morgan asked for me again; I was too busy taking in the information and forming pictures of my own to really speak without vomiting. An overdose on Dilaudid... I visibly shivered at the news. That substance... so addicting, so enticing... there were many times I thought I would overdose and die. It was horrible, living like that... Edwards nodded, ""Yeah, I got what I could before she went into surgery. Las Vegas Forensics already came and got them. In my entire career, I have never seen anything like it. Her genitals were hacked away at with some kind of knife. I... have never seen that amount of abuse and scaring to a patient and had them survive."" ""Has she said anything? Anything at all?"" Morgan took the papers she offered him and scanned over them quickly. She shook her head again, ""Nothing but Dr. Reid""s name. When we tried to check her vitals, she had a fit and we had to sedate her."" Morgan nodded, ""That""s understandable after what she""s gone through."" We finally reached Nephilim""s room. Dr. Edwards opened the door and went in, Morgan following behind her. He stopped halfway through the door and turned to look at me. I had stopped, staring inside the room. After everything that had happened, I felt... nervous. My palms felt sweaty and I could feel my face become hot. A smirk worked it""s way onto Morgan""s face as he reached forward and grabbed my tie, pulling me into the room hard enough that I stumbled. ""Morgan, why""d-"" I spun around to look at him, but stopped short at the sound of a voice behind me. ""Spence...?"" Her voice was tired and weak, holding the sleepy softness of one that just woke up.",748687
1395,"Not until fifteen minutes later did I manage to go up to the balcony again and look down into the crowd once more, my eyes thoroughly scanning the people down there, searching for her. But I didn""t find her. I still hadn""t given up the hope of finding Yves when another two hours had passed. And I was finally rewarded: I discovered her standing at a table, talking to the same blonde woman she had greeted before. She seemed more sober than two hours ago. She was standing firmly on the ground and the hand that held another cigarette (when did she start smoking? I wondered) was steady. I argued with myself if I should go over, but I decided against it. If the kiss had really been a sort of closure - something to end this odd something between us - then she might be bothered if I tried to talk to her about it. So I decided to remain within her eyesight; if she wanted to talk to me, she could just come up to me and do so. I was alone. I stood there, watching the people on the dancefloor, for about ten minutes, now and then casting a secret glance from the corner of my eye over to Yves. She was still talking to the blonde. I looked at the dancefloor again when I noticed that Yves was moving. I slowly turned my head into her direction. She reached me and went straight up to me. She put a hand on my chest. ""Hey,"" I said, lightly touching her shoulder. She didn""t say anything, but she came closer to me and kissed me again. This kiss landed somewhere on the corner of my mouth and I felt the tip of her tongue only briefly, for before I could react she had withdrawn again, smiled at me and continued her way. Although I kept searching the whole club for her, I couldn""t find her after this last incident. I supposed she had left. I couldn""t find this Jake guy, either, so the question remained whether he was her new boyfriend or not. And whether Yves had wanted to tell me something by the kiss. I couldn""t figure it out, and when I left at about five in the morning, I had my head full of images of Yves and of the feeling of her lips against mine. And I decided to call her the next day. Provided that I dared.",240213
507,"Tygra took off his crown again, resting it on a far corner of the table, and ran his hands through his hair once before he said, ""Okay. So how do you propose we do this?"" Lion-O wasn""t sure what his brother was referring to, but looking at the map, he thought it looked like a plan for battle. He swallowed. ""What do we know?"" Tygra pointed to one section of the map, ""Mumm-Ra""s forces will be concentrated here."" He moved his finger to another section, ""But his more technologically-advanced forces will be here."" He pointed up to the outer wall of the Kingdom""s defenses. ""If this wall doesn""t hold, Lion-O, all will be lost."" Tygra sighed again. ""It""s days like this I wish Father were still here."" So he was gone in this realm as well? Lion-O""s head dropped, feeling the loss of his father once more. He looked to his brother and noticing the sword on his brother""s arm, his own twitched, feeling naked without it. He tried to concentrate on the task at hand. ""What do we have?"" The King pointed at where he said the main force would be, ""I was planning on leading most of the ThunderCats and other troops here."" He pointed to the other spot. ""And have you hold the wall."" He looked up, ""Are your troops ready, you""ve shown them how to use the bombs we created?"" Lion-O didn""t know how to answer. He looked to his guide, who still in her female form had snuck into the room with him. She nodded. ""Yeah, they""re ready."" Tygra studied the map again, nodding, ""We have a chance, Lion-O. But this could work."" He stood up completely, and began to rub his neck. ""How are we on supplies?"" Lion-O wasn""t used to seeing Tygra like this. It""d been minutes since he""d made a snide comment or a joke. It unnerved him, almost more than being treated as an equal. He turned to the guide again, who nodded again. ""We""re ready to go, your majesty."" Tygra""s lip curled, ""Don""t call me that."" He spoke again, but quietly this time, ""I hate this, Lion-O. I hate every minute of it."" ""Being king?"" Lion-O questioned, but Tygra didn""t reply, it almost seemed like he""d dozed off since his eyes were closed and he wasn""t moving. Lion-O looked at the Sword on his brother""s arm. He barely whispered, ""I would want to be king."" Amazingly, Tygra had heard him. ""You would want this?"" He questioned. Lion-O thought about it. The responsibility, the sacrifice... But he answered the only way he found he could, ""Yes."" ""I""ll remember that, brother."" Suddenly, someone burst through the door. He bowed to the King and the Prince. ""Your Majesties, Mumm-Ra approaches."" On the wall was not a great place to be before a battle. All that hung in the air was the nervous tension of the upcoming battle. The enemy could barely be seen, but it was still enough to cause the warriors to tremble. Lion-O hated that he was impressed by his brother""s strategy. Many of the animals had united together under the ThunderCat banner, and he kept every group just separate enough to sure there would be no chance of switching of sides. The king had even sprinkled clerics throughout the ranks. ""You look nervous, Prince Lion-O.""",1497577
443,"""Rio would have done something about it. I think he always does."" ""What?"" He vaguely heard his voice; it was dark and evil sounding, much like a villain in a dramatic cartoon. ""Well... Bubble-Bear, I mean, Bubbles said that Rio""s dealt with that guy before. But he always comes back. The farthest he""s gone is touching Blossom""s ass- and then Rio, he broke his arm..."" Hearing that his own attempt at saving his girlfriend virtue had been one-upped, and with the physical pain that Brick had been tempted to inflict himself, deflated his anger into apathy. ""B-but-Blossom seemed really happy that you would go through all that trouble of wrapping the guy in duct tape, raw Canadian bacon and fish heads for her... I think."" Brick wasn""t buying it, and away he flew to lick his wounds. Once in his own room, with Spitfire trailing, Brick flopped back on the bed and thought of Bloss. Even in the dark void that was his room, she appeared in his mind. ""Bloss..."" he murmured. He hadn""t even asked her out the second time yet; he was slipping. ""You called?"" her voice was a clear sound in the dark recesses of his room. ""Hey..."" he choked out. She wiggled her fingers in that weird salute giggly girls at his old prep school (he got kicked out of three months after enrolling) used to do as he walked by. A rosy blush was on her cheeks as she hovered outside his window. ""Can I come in?"" ""What do I get in return?"" he replied. He was a certified M. He was dying to let her in and ravish her lips until he could salvage his image in her eyes. He was supposed to be the bad boy. ""A kiss..."" she answered, rather low. Good thing he""d been listening so intently for her reply, or he""d have never rocketed the three yard distance from his bed to the window in 0.78 seconds flat. He let her in and received a kiss... on the cheek. ""Tease."" Brick muttered following close behind her. ""I never said where."" Bloss pointed out, her face reddening. She sat on his bed, a pink petal in a storm of blood red. Her face seemed to redden even more. ""I came to tell you about the report I got from Professor; you said you wanted to hear about it."" He nodded and took a seat behind her, pulling her into the nest he made with his legs. ""So, what does the report say, Sakura?"" She stiffened in his arms. He must have hit a nerve. ""What? Rio, boy wonder, calls you that. Can""t I?"" ""It""s just a pet name. When I started learning Japanese, Rio was with me. The teacher gave us all new names for a week, and made us learn to write them in romanji. Sakura kind of stuck, so he calls me that. It""s nothing."" Brick rolled his eyes. ""Right... Like he wouldn""t have a secret crush on you..."" He""d spoken to the guy, and wanted to knock out his teeth; he guy had nothing but glowing, adoring comments on Bloss. And Rio the magnificent had all but said he didn""t like her dating Brick-and even mention that her last boyfriend had been an honor student who had previously studied in Germany or something, Dexter or Baxter... ""He""s just overprotective... He had a little sister once. She... she disappeared.""",3439302
414,"""Wouldn""t she want to avoid a place like that?"" ""No,"" Was all Ulrich said, before turning heel and leaving the room. Jeremie headed to the park, his laptop and school bag at his side. He had arrived extremely early, but he didn""t want to miss Yumi. He wished Ulrich had asked this of Aelita instead. She was a person who was kind, caring and easy to open up to. She would probably know what to say and what to do in times like this. He thought briefly about getting advice from Aelita, without giving away his reasons for asking but something stopped Jeremie from reaching for his phone. Ulrich""s warning bounced around his head. ""Only you can help her, Jeremie,"" Ulrich had told him. ""But I wonder... are you ready to know why?"" Apparently Jeremie wasn""t privy to just why it had to be him. Not that it mattered now. He sat on a shaded bench and took a deep breath, while staring up at the cloudless, blue sky. Was he really someone important to Yumi beyond his geeky computer nerd persona? There was really nothing special about him. He sent Aelita a quick text message saying he would be busy for the rest of the day. Jeremie: I""ll have to reschedule our lunch. Something important came up with my parents, and I can""t get out of it. Aelita: I understand, so don""t worry about it. But is everything okay? Jeremie: Everything is fine. I have to go, but I""ll talk to you later, okay? I""ll have to turn my phone off for a while. Yeah, Jeremie was never that great of a liar but Aelita trusted him and really, he felt bad for taking advantage of it. But if Yumi really needed him as much as Ulrich seemed to think so... it was for a worthy cause. Surely Aelita would understand. Now, Ulrich was prepared for Yumi to intervene in his scene with William, possibly even Jeremie (despite not giving Jeremie the location of his meeting place with Yumi). But never had he seen this coming. ""You are one sick puppy,"" Odd said teasingly. Ulrich wasn""t sure if Odd was accusing or joking with him. Either way, he had been caught with his pants down-literally. William was on his knees, blindfolded with Ulrich""s monstrous cock down his throat. Ulrich left just enough space for William to breathe, barely. Ulrich had to keep calm. Yumi wasn""t due for a while and no one was supposed to be here. If Ulrich lost concentration over his control of William... But Ulrich was a Dominant, still high on his power trip over his submissive. He closed his eyes, felt William""s breath on his cock, the shallow breaths William was taking just to stay alive. Being interrupted during his scene with William had always been the plan... but it was Odd. The problem with Odd was that Ulrich had no idea how his friend would react to finding out Ulrich""s relationship in this manner. This was supposed to be for Yumi""s eyes only but now... what happens now? ""It""s exactly what it looks like,"" Ulrich said, leaning heavily against the tree. He began fucking in and out of William""s mouth slowly. ""I admit, this wasn""t meant for your eyes,"" he added. He peeked over at Odd but found his friend""s expression unreadable.",583994
2522,"""And you""ll still need to pay for parts."" ""Done,"" Puck replied with a grin, before offering a hearty whack to Kurt""s back. ""Pleasure doing business with you."" He should have held out for three months, Kurt reflected as he watched Puck make his way over to the Latina cheerleader and try to wrap an arm around her waist. Rolling his eyes, he made his way to his classroom, making a mental note to get his coveralls out of the back of his truck. As soon as class began, he flipped open his copy of Hot Rod Magazine, ignoring the lesson Schu was trying to teach. Kurt was guaranteed at least a C in the class since he""d made a deal to join the Glee Club (honestly, how gay could you get? ), so he didn""t really care about learning the language. What he did care about was the article on the new ISIS wiring system. It""d always been that way for Kurt, for as long as he could remember. His first memories were of hanging out in a playpen in his father""s garage, watching his dad work on the vehicles that were brought in. Not too long after, his father had shown him how to perform basic maintenance, and the rest was history. If there was one thing in the world Kurt loved, it was cars. He dreamed of becoming a NASCAR driver (though F1 would be acceptable as well), but knew the first step would be gaining a thorough understanding of how the vehicles worked. Spending all his free time - with occasional breaks for watching sports or driving his four-wheeler - working on cars was his way of life. There was nothing like getting under the hood and making it work better. It was such a rush to look at a beautiful piece of machinery and know he""d been involved in creating it. And sometimes, it was a sense of pity that moved him, because some cars didn""t deserve the abuse their owners put them through. Even a car as pathetic as Puck""s needed a bit of love. Puck yanked him over to the 1996 Ford F-Series as soon as school was done for the day. ""I think it""s the carburetor,"" Puck said. ""Do you even know what a carburetor is?"" Puck""s face flushed. ""Of course I do,"" he snapped back. ""A lot of car problems come from the computer systems that run them,"" Kurt said. ""It""s not as simple as it used to be. Turn it on so I can hear it."" Puck gave him a distrustful look, but obediently turned it on. The noise didn""t start immediately, but it wasn""t too long before a soft bwwob bwoobbubwub came from under the hood. Kurt rolled his eyes. Puck really was an idiot who knew nothing about cars. He motioned for Puck to shut it off. ""You""re low on coolant,"" he said, trying not to roll his eyes. ""I have some extra in my kit."" It took less than five minutes for Kurt to remedy the problem. He felt a bit weird fixing it as Puck watched him, because he was leaving himself defenseless as he bent over the engine block. Thankfully Puck was smart enough to realize messing with his mechanic would be a stupid idea. ""You""ll probably need to take it in for an inspection soon, but this will see you through your hot date with Santana tomorrow night,"" Kurt pronounced as he shut the hood.",1112924
505,"But instead of coming back to the real world, Lion-O found himself being thrown elsewhere. Or more accurately, it felt as though he""d made the connection with the Sword of Omens, and it was pulling him into itself. When Lion-O opened his eyes, he found himself in a place much like what the realm of Thundera once was. Though it was a little off, as there was a tension in the air, as if a threat was coming. It was the first time the Sword had ever done something like this, transported him to another time and place. It reminded Lion-O of his time in the Book of Omens. ""Are you really so surprised? We share similar names, should we not share other traits as well?"" Lion-O was stunned by the appearance of a companion. It was a silver, female ThunderCat. Long and lean, she had the sharpest teeth and claws he""d ever seen. ""Who are you?"" The other cat smiled, ""Do you really not know? I""m hurt, Lion-O. After all, I am a part of you."" Lion-O felt as though he""d stumbled into a dream. ""You""re the Sword of Omens."" The stunning cat smiled even wider, ""And the others doubt your intelligence."" ""Why are you like that?"" He motioned to her (its?) stunning figure. ""Oh, I can take any form I wish in here."" She deliberately posed in a manner that made her even more striking. ""It seemed the best way to get your attention, to be an attractive female."" Her red eyes glittered, ""A lesson Cheetara seems to know well."" Lion-O blushed and the Sword of Omens laughed. She threw an arm around his shoulders to comfort him, ""Don""t be embarrassed, child. I""ve seen much in my many years. Now come, think of me as your guide here."" Lion-O followed, but asked, ""Where are we?"" ""A plane of existence, much like the ones you""ve visited before, only this one is mine, so only the bearer of the Sword, or me, can enter here. By the way, only you can hear and see me though everyone else here sees you as the Lion-O of this realm."" Lion-O looked down, and saw that we was garbed in his old royal attire though he appeared he was also far more grown. He also noticed they were headed to the palace. ""Okay then. But why are we here?"" His guide smirked, as though she had a secret, ""To reassure you that I never choose wrong."" Lion-O was confused, and growing tired of his guide""s riddling answers. He was secretly glad his sword couldn""t talk under normal circumstances or else he""d probably have constant headaches. ""What does that mean?"" Now that they were in the palace, his guide stopped walking. She looked over her shoulder to answer him, rather than turning fully, ""In this plane of existence, Tygra was chosen as king and it""s been two years since the war against Mumm-Ra began. Though few died in the first attack, unlike in your world. So he has an army to fight with."" Lion-O""s ears flattened. So he was a complete failure here and in his own world? If Tygra had been king after Claudius, their race wouldn""t be nearly extinct now. The Sword noticed his change in mood and immediate set to comfort him with the truth, ""Many things in this world differ from your own.",1497577
1345,"I need your encouragement and opinions. Chapter Two: Darkness Spreads Zelda and Valla rode with the Wind Temple messenger as fast as they could. The King needed to know of the dire circumstances immediately. But the sun had already set on them. ""What if we are waylaid, Princess?"" Valla asked nervously. ""Then we shall have to fight any Re-Deads, Poes, or Stalfos that stand against us."" ""Majesty! Look out!"" cried the messenger. Zelda reined her horse just as a Stalfos popped form the ground, swinging it""s mace. Zelda reached behind and drew the short sword she""d packed in just such a case. She swung, hit the Stalfos, then ducked as it swung at her. Then the princess gave her horse a command, and the nimble mare leaped over the monster. While it was confused, Zelda hit it several more times, until it""s head came loose and flew into the air. With one hard swing, she cleaved the skull in two. ""Follow me! Hurry!"" she ordered the servant and messenger. As they rode on they were nearly over come by a Re-Dead and another Stalfos, but Zelda managed to fend them off as well. Finally, they saw the castle in the distance. As Zelda peered ahead, she saw another company on horse back coming form the south. Immediately her heart sank, for she knew it meant something had happened to the sage form the Earth Temple. This distressed Zelda greatly because she had actually known Laruto, and the Zora had had another baby just last month. The Guards recognized her even form the distance. The captain, Gonlo, called for the bridge to be lowered again. ""Highness,"" Gonlo said, ""Thank goodness you""re safe."" ""Not now,"" she said to the overly devoted captain of the guard. ""I must see my father, now,"" she ran past him, the northern messenger following close, and hurried to the throne room. They entered before the page boys could announce the fanfare that protocol ordered be done for a princess. Inside, two Zoras kneeled before King Daphnese. They hadn""t even begun their sad tale. ""Zelda!"" the king exclaimed, ""Where have you been?"" ""In the north,"" she answered. ""We bring terrible tidings, father."" ""Fado the Wind Sage is dead,"" the boy behind her said. ""I was helping him attend to the evening prayer, when the main sanctuary turned ash gray, and the ground rumbled beneath our feet. He ordered me to leave the temple at once through the wind warp. Before I vanished, I saw the floor crack open, and a giant worm came up, and ATE him!"" the boy erupted in tears, and Zelda put a comforting hand on his tiny shoulders. ""Much the same happened to madam Laruto."" said one of the Zoras. ""Highness, she was also praying to the gods when she and her eldest daughter, her apprentice, were suddenly surrounded in the same ash gray colors. Then, as the child escaped, she saw many Poes merge together, and her mother was strangled by the giant phantom the Poes became."" ""This is indeed very troubling,"" the King said, sitting down again in his throne. But then more messengers came.",512464

Maybe you""ll teach us a little something."" Marshall added.

Johnny was surprised to see Mike come by and didn""t expect him to find him in all places; a skate park. Mike climbs onto Johnny""s shoulder, to which the gorilla responded, ""Sorry, Mike.

Then they peeked into the hall, and saw Russel setting up one of the beds from his and his brother""s room for Noah in a room filled with boxes and such, as well as old toys and a wooden crib pushed into a corner. ""Yes...Though, it was more of a large closet after Mum and Dad passed,"" Fletcher said. Then he stepped back, and asked, ""Al, after church tomorrow, would you like to go fishing with Winry and me?"" ""Um...Oka-"" Al started to say, then Ed interjected, ""After Church? Why not go at sun up when there""s better chances of catching something?"" This, Russel heard, and he looked out to the hallway. ""Everyone in our village goes to Morning Mass,"" the elder Tringam sounded a bit displeased, ""Don""t you and your brother go to church on Sunday?"" Al opened his mouth, but Ed answered, ""We""re scientists. We believe in what we can see. You should understand if you""re studying rocket science."" Russel emerged from the room, leaving the bed half competed, ""My chosen profession has nothing to do with my faith."" ""Faith is well and good,"" Ed said, ""But in my experience, I""ve never seen a single shred of evidence to support what most people believe in."" ""Ed,"" Al said, not wanting them to get into a fight. He and Russel stared each other down, and suddenly the taller man smirked, ""Then let""s make a deal...Call it a scientific experiment."" ""What?"" asked Ed. ""I""ve got five weeks left before Fletch and I have to go back to London. That means, counting tomorrow, we""ll have five Sundays before we go. Come with us to Mass for each of those days, and see if it changes your opinion."" Ed thought it over. Then he held out his hand, ""Alright..."" ""Ed,"" Al said. But he was ignored for the moment as the two men shook on it. When they were done, Russel went back to finish helping Noah with her room. However, Al grabbed Ed""s shoulders, and said, ""Um, Fletcher, can you excuse us?"" then he closed the bedroom door, and said, low, but still spastic, ""What do you think you""re doing!?"" ""Come on,"" Ed said, ""The religions here are no different than the ones we""ve seen. All stories and legends, but no scientific proof."" ""But..."" Al said, ""Why do I feel guilty about this? Shouldn""t we have gone just to be nice? Does it have to be a bet?"" ""It wasn""t a bet,"" Ed assured him. ""Besides, I don""t think it will change anything...I mean, don""t you agree, Al?"" he asked. Al looked down, his expression sheepish, as if he didn""t want to admit something.",512464
1187,"Prentiss nodded and pulled out a list; a list of seven locations in Las Vegas, ""He told us where they probably are."" ""Dr. Smith did tell us that the Children of Seth""s Holy Mother is here in Las Vegas.I already gave Garcia the addresses he gave us of where they may be and told her to cross-reference them to the locations of the crime scenes and anything else she could think of,"" Morgan said, ""Right now, the LVPD is interrogation Smith to see if they can get anything else out of-"" ""Hold on,"" My eyes widened as I stared at the addresses on the paper, ""This address..."" I pointed to the seventh on the list, ""... it""s the address of Nephilim""s house."" ""What?"" Morgan looked over at the paper, ""He told us it was a church."" ""I heard that someone had bought her house and had it converted into a church,"" I said quickly, averting my eyes. Suddenly it felt hard to get air, like there was a weight on my chest. It never occurred to me... I had never even thought that it was suspicious that once the house was put up for sale - the Christenson""s didn""t have any close relatives that could take it - that it would be bought. The same day even... ""Then the church will be the first place we look,"" Hotchner stated, standing up along with Rossi and Morgan. ""Wait, what-"" All of a sudden, I felt my cellphone vibrate, nearly making me jump in surprise. The others stared as I flipped it open and answered it with a slow ""... hello?"" ""You are too slow, Supervisory Special Agent Doctor Spencer Reid,"" Came a deep, obviously electronically modified voice from the other end, ""She has been in labor for fourteen hours already. Have you found Smith yet? That man had no spine, no spirit... his child proved the least worthy of all the Children of the Sun. What about our lovely church? Have you found it yet? Hopefully you will soon..."" There was a loud, raspy scream from the other end. The phone slipped from my hand and fell to the floor as my eyes widened. That scream... I knew it. I had heard it before, whenever needles got close to her. Nephilim had always been quite phobic of needles... Morgan reached down and grabbed the phone, pressing the speaker button on it, ""Ah, judging by that noise, I would say you got the message. As you no doubt know by now, she is with me. We are at the church; you have one hour before we move her. I suggest you hurry."" At first, the team tried to convince me to stay behind, but anyone that saw the look on my face after that call ended quickly retracted their objections. Nothing could stop me from going to that church; not after everything that had happened. So here we were; Hotch was driving, I was in the passenger seat, and the others minus Garcia and J.J. were in the back. Behind us was a few police cars and an ambulance. He had said she was in labor... and that scream... none of us were taking any chances. It was darkening outside, just after sunset. It stared out of the window, my eyes unfocused and staring at the blurred city illuminated by the flashing red and blue lights.",748687
1281,"Ulrich stroked the base of his submissive""s skull, and William released a low, purring noise from his throat. The final buckle wrapped around to the front, interlocking with a D-ring; all that was missing was the padlock. ""I""ll see you tonight, my sweet William."" Ulrich said, kissing him on the lips. When the padlock clicked into place, William""s consciousness faded. William closed his eyes and let the darkness-and the safety of Ulrich""s presence, overtake him. His body was now under Ulrich""s control. Now, Ulrich has trained and held many submissives over the years, but William was the only one who could suppress his mental functions so completely so as to (what seemed to Ulrich) disable his short-term memory but leave all William""s other functions intact. Ulrich lived on control and while he disapproved of X.A.N.A. forcibly taking control of William""s body, he had to admit, somewhere inside of him Ulrich had been jealous. Because whatever feelings Ulrich held towards William personally, he had sensed William""s submissive side soon after they met. Call it a third sense, but Ulrich lived for control over submissives. Normally he wouldn""t have been able to tell, but lifestyle submissives, those he could spot a mile away. Because they were different from the rest. They lived for people like Ulrich, for Dominants to control their every move, to live and breathe the D/s lifestyle. So damn it all that X.A.N.A. had gotten to William first. Once William was freed from X.A.N.A. ""s control, Ulrich had been done waiting. X.A.N.A. had gotten to William before Ulrich had been able to begin operation ""Control William"". Yeah, it was a stupid title, but it""s not like anyone was going to find out. But now William was free and Ulrich would make damn sure it didn""t stay that way because Ulrich had plans, and his currently goal was making (and keeping) William as his submissive. By any means necessary. Ulrich was a bastard. He called Yumi to ""their spot"" in the forest, because Aelita""s appearance in the real world sparked a fire inside him. Ulrich saw how happy Aelita and Jeremie were to finally be able to touch each other, to know they are now standing in the same room instead of through a virtual screen. Those emotions, the relief and happiness those two felt, had been contagious. Yet, it also reminded Ulrich that he had been stringing along his relationship with Yumi. He liked her, and before William, he had been sure that ""like"" was close enough to ""love"" that Ulrich had confused the two. See, submissives for Ulrich had always been that, not involved in his daily life outside of what use they could provide him. Finding a submissive to become a willingly helpless slave... it was a rare trait, and so far, not one had even come close to the wonders he found within William. Ulrich kept William at a distance during their ""training"" period. Yet had underestimated just how submissive William was. Somewhere along the way, the lines between submissive and William began to converge. Ulrich shook his head, shrugging off the past. Now was no time to reminisce.",583994
1552,"Loki had read the entire library, but had never come across such a book. She merely glanced up at him, before returning her eyes to the pages. ""If you are ignoring me, the punishment for that is execution."" ""I highly doubt you can execute me so quickly without knowing why I am ignoring you."" ""I could care less."" He stubbornly replied, plopping down on the couch beside her, sitting up straight and leaning his elbows on his knees. He glared at her, her eyes still running across every sentence. ""What is so more interesting in that book than myself?"" ""This book is about Frost Giants."" Loki""s breath caught and he gulped, laying back in his seat. ""Why would you be reading such a thing?"" ""I had only read about them from a previous script earlier this week, I need to know more though..."" Recognizing his adorable confusion, she made a simple simper in his direction. ""I was of course upset with you after the incident believing it was your magic that had harmed me, but I had a revelation..."" Loki loved how she spoke, he had realized her usual voice was fading more and more into an Aesir vocabulary and it amused him thoroughly. ""I realized that you were a frost giant and now I must read to learn more about my husband."" ""I love you Ava."" He whispered breathlessly, she would do anything to be his equal and for that he loved her. He loved her for her beauty, her intelligence, innocence even... He never would let her soul go alone. Past all the rock and rubble of Old New York City, she saw curiosity, she saw a playground. She did not see the dangers of passing over to Asgardian territory. Her long black hair was pulled up into a lengthy pony tail, her glistening blue eyes captured all there was to see. Her attire was torn up and unclean, as was her pale skin which was covered in dirt and grim. She wore a red tank top ripped at the bottom revealing part of her flat stomach and accented curves. Her lower torso wore jean pants torn to the thigh and her shoes were nike white ripped soles. Her friend Margaret was following nervously behind, their parents always told them to stay clear of the Old city. Years ago Loki had succeeded at taking over the world, the humans were enslaved by the Chitauri and very few people ever came across Loki unless they were to die a slow and agonizing death. Passing over the borders was surely one of the worst things Ava had thought of doing. She had turned eighteen and that meant adulthood, but the world was never the same under Loki""s rule. Now the proper age to go exploring would be early forties, if people went exploring at all. Ava vaulted over a fallen lamppost and hopped up onto a rather large chunk of the skyscraper that still towered ahead. She was not born when Loki had taken over, but she was however curious as to what went on in the City before he burned it to the ground. ""U-Um... Ava, I think we should turn around. This place is off limits remember?"" ""Yeah, I know."" She then hopped down from the rock and began walking around, eyes grazed over the cracks that scattered across the ice smooth road.",6234395
1588,"The animals looked up and saw Verne standing in front of him and then said, ""Not without me. You need a leader to find a kid who looks like RJ."" RJ smiled and said, ""I knew you came to your senses."" The animals continued to look around and search for Mookie until they heard a guitar playing. Heather walked around wondering where the sound is coming from. The others followed her and it ended up under the picnic table. Heather looked under the table and she saw Mookie. He stopped playing, then looked up and saw Heather standing here. ""What are you doing here?"" asked Mookie. ""We""re looking for you."" said Heather. Verne walked towards Mookie and said, ""What do you want? Are you gonna say anything negative about me?"" ""No. I just came to tell you that I""m sorry about all the stuff I said. The day before, I was misunderstood by your feelings. Yesterday, I was out of line. I was just jealous about everyone giving you your attention and helping yu out with your time of need. For that, I hope you""ll forgive me."" said Verne. Mookie smiled and said, ""Come here."" Verne came close to him and gave him a big hug. Mookie asked, ""So, are we cool?"" ""Yeah, we""re cool."" The animals cheered excitedly and RJ said, ""I""m glad that everything worked out pretty well."" ""My daughter really likes you as a little brother."" said Ozzie. Mookie looked at Heather and said, ""It""s true. So, I see today""s your 13th."" ""It feels like it."" ""Come on, everyone. Let""s go home."" said Verne. The animals went out of the park and walked back home to the hedge along with Mookie..., where he seriously belongs. The gang went back to the forest and Mookie looked at the animals and realized that this is home the whole time. RJ came to him and said, ""You know, I wished that you would live here for a long time to come. I never knew I had a brother until now. It""s very awesome to see that I can see you in my eyes."" ""You ain""t gonna get all mushy-gushy on us, aren""t you?"" asked Mookie. ""Yeah."" ""It""s working."" ""So, Mookie. You want to be a part of this family?"" asked Verne. Mookie stared at the animals and puts down his bag and said, ""Absolutely. I""ll be very lucky to be a part of it."" Hammy came with tears in his eyes, then ran to Mookie and said, ""Oh, come here. I""ve never felt so happy before."" Then, Mookie hugged Hammy deeply. Ozzie came to him and said, ""Welcome to the family... forever."" Everyone came to him and gave him a group hug. Mookie said, ""This is the most awesome birthday present I""ve ever gotten. I couldn""t wish for anything more."" Hours later, RJ and Heather came to Mookie and said, ""Wanna catch a movie? Can""t start without you."" ""All right. I""m coming."" said Mookie. Mookie followed them and reminisced those moments he had with his mom and his new family when he played a somber song on his iPod. He sighed and stared at the sky, and walked away as the song plays.",1276465
2159,"He walked away, leaving Mookie feeling a little distraught. He might make himself feel better by singing a little song. He brought out his guitar and strummed it and sang to himself feeling a little lonely and misunderstood. He thought of his mother and makes it better with a song he wrote a few years ago. Seems like it was yesterday when I saw your face You told me how proud you were But I walked away If only I knew what I know today Ooh-ooh I would hold you in my arms I would take the pain away Thank you for all you""ve done Forgive all your mistakes There""s nothing I would do To hear your voice again Sometimes I wanna call you But I know you won""t be there Ohh, I""m sorry for blaiming you For everything I just couldn""t do And I""ve hurt myself by hurting you Somedays I feel broke inside But I won""t admit Sometimes I just wanna hide Cause it""s you I miss And it""s so hard to say goodbye When it comes to this Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah Would you tell me I was wrong?Would you help me understand Are you looking down upon me? Are you proud of who I am? There""s nothing I wouldn""t do To have just one more chance To look into your eyes And see you looking back Ohh, I""m sorry for blaming you For everything I just couldn""t do And I""ve hurt myself Ohh, If I had just one more day I would tell you how much that I missed you Since you went away Ohh, it""s dangerous It""s so out of line To try to turn back time... I""m sorry for blaming you For everything I just couldn""t do And I""ve hurt myself... Mookie strummed the guitar and finished the song with a tear in his eye and his voice broke. By hurting you Then, he started to cry and walked back to the log while everyone was sleeping. He laid down and fell asleep with one tear shed down from his face, thinking about his mom. That song was ""Hurt"" from Christina Aguilera. I felt it was a very sweet and gentle song for Mookie. Read and review, please! Chapter 5: Comforting Mookie The next morning, Mookie went through his pictures of him and his mom, spending time when he was a kid. He laughed to himself and sniffled a little. He wiped his eyes and said, ""Man, I miss her so badly."" Heather walked past him and said, ""Hi. Can I sit with you?"" Mookie stared at her and nodded his head. She sat next to Mookie in a rock and said, ""What are you doing?"" ""Looking through my pictures so just me and my mom having fun. I""ve had such an awesome childhood. Now that she""s gone, I just feel like I""ve got no one around me."" said Mookie. ""Well, you have us."" said Heather. ""Not according to Verne. He told me last night that I would be better off somewhere else and that you like me better than him. I don""t take anyone""s place as leader. I didn""t mean to leave him out in the cold."" said Mookie. ""That""s just the way Verne is. He""s afraid that everything will change when there""s new people here. Just give him some time and he""ll get used to you."" said Heather. Mookie sighed and said, ""I don""t know, Heath. I don""t think he likes me. I don""t know what else to do.""

1961,"Tsu""tey""s P.O.V I watched as the three of them entered. Neytiri, my promised, JakeSully, the so-called warrior, and then came her. She was dressed in Omaticaya wardrobe, and everything about her made the parts below my waist ache. She was beautiful, and if it weren""t disgracing the All-mother, I would call her Eywa herself. She looked like a goddess with her sky blue eyes, and lightly colored hair. I watched as her mate glared down the men that looked at her, and my eyes narrowed. You wouldn""t challenge me if I tried for her. I""d have you on the dirt pleading for your life within moments. They made their way over to were Neytiri had found a spot for them, a little clumsily, however she showed much more grace than her mate. As she sat down I looked her over much more closely and then suddenly I met her eyes. How long had she been looking? I turned my eyes away and glared at her mate next to her as he simply just gave me one right back. Then he turned to her and spoke a few words, which earned him a smile I would kill to see on her face, created by me. She said something back to him before Neytiri returned and placed a bowel of fruit in front of them. The girl immediately grabbed for one she must have recognized and bit into it hungrily. There was nothing delicate about her eating habits though. She was just like one of the boys when it came to that. Then again, maybe she was just hungry. Suddenly my attention was turned to look at my father beside me, as he spoke, ""I""ve never seen such strange beauty within all my life. Any suitor here would probably fight to the death for her."" It was then that I realized he knew I had been looking at her. ""Yes, but I am promised to Neytiri. Besides she""s a dreamwalker with a mate,"" I told him as he simply nodded and said, ""I was simply telling you what I thought."" I smiled at him and nodded as I turned back to eat my own dinner. Jake""s P.O.V Later after dinner, Neytiri led us to where we were going to sleep. Walking across a large limb she suddenly jumped down into a leaf like net. Looking at Mia, she gave a nod as we followed Neytiri""s example. I took the net next to Neytiri, while Mia got the one next to me. It was difficult to getting situated, but when I did I turned on my side to look at Neytiri. She gave me a cold glare before grabbing the side of the leaf and pulling only slightly, before letting go as it did the rest from there. Soon she was encased in the net and lying on her other side away from me. Sighing, I closed my eyes and let my mind go blank. Suddenly I was hurtling through bright neon lights, before hitting the special white light, where my surroundings started to become clear as the blurriness slowly slipped away. However there was still a blinding light as Dr. Augustine hovered over me with a flashlight, calling my name. ""Jake! Come on back kid,"" she said slapping my cheeks trying to wake me up better. ""Come on, that""s it,"" she said shaking my head as I blinked my eyes and let my mind slip back into my on head slowly.",806976
1084,"I journeyed with the other ghosts you encountered here, to Tartarus. Soon though, I started to question my choices. I have sworn to help anyone I could, how could I now pledge allegiance to Gaea and kill multitudes of people for the sake of my petty revenge? No. I may not have been able to take back my choices, but at least I could help you two escape."" Percy stared at the guy, not sure what to say. ""Well... thanks,"" he finally managed. Asclepius smiled. ""No thank you for putting me back on the right track. If we had not encountered the two of you, I still may have been intent on only revenge, you two have reminded me of myself. For that, I am in your debt. Now come. Being dead, I can sense the Doors of Death. They call me to them. I can lead you there."" Not knowing what else to do, Percy looked to Annabeth, who nodded, They both followed the ghost farther into Tartarus, but hopefully closer to getting out. A/N There! Finally done! Did you like it? Please tell me what you thought. I want to thank you guys for the amazing amount of support this story has gotten, please continue! Sorry about the lack of contractions when the ghosts were speaking, I did it to try to make it seem like older language but sorry if it annoyed anyone!

In fact I really should be working on school stuff right now, but whatever. Anyway, than you thank you thank you to anyone who reviewed/favorited/alerted this story! You guys rock! Okay, we""re finally back to the other lot! Sorry if the action is a little quick, I was writing it a bit fast. Also, I don""t really know how the Argo two looks or where things are situated exactly, so guessed. I""m sorry if it turns out that it was incorrect, I don""t have time to go through and double check things with the book. Sorry for those of you where stuff like that get""s on your nerves! (I""m one of them, so I do deeply apologize, but I really have no time!) Jason turned to Piper. ""I""m going to fight them in the air,"" he told her. She nodded and pulled out Katoptris. She looked nervous. Jason didn""t blame her. Her... talents wouldn""t be very much help in this situation. And, with what happened to Percy and Annabeth the reality of what they were facing had slapped all of them. How easy it would be to fall in battle; just one lucky hit from the enemy and you were dead. They""re not dead yet! He reminded himself angrily. Still, his hopes weren""t high. Even though he knew how strong Annabeth was and even though he""d heard all the stories about Percy at Camp Half-Blood, Jason still found it hard to believe that anyone could survive Tartraus. Well Nico, had, or so he claimed. It was yet another reason why Jason found it hard to trust the son of Hades. He stole another glance at Piper and prayed to all the gods that she would stay safe in this fight then he jumped over the edge. In a second, he was flying through the air.

Both Yami and the housekeeper were stunned at what they saw... ""What happened to your hump?"" Yami asked, flabbergasted. Joegore""s back was as straight as a pin! ""WHAT HUMP!?!"" Joegore demanded. ""My cloak""s padded! I got a weak back- not a hunched one!"" ""But... why do you walk like that?"" Yami asked. ""I got a football injury here?"" Joegore said sarcastically.

""I wound have shacked up with him years ago if I had."" ""Wanna start now?"" Joegore asked, wiggling his eyebrows again. ""Why not,"" Kikyo (lightening, thunder, horses, scream) shrugged. ""It""s either you or Fido in the basement.""

""A riot,"" the inspector said, ""Is an ugly thing."" ""I think it""s about time we had one,"" Miroku suggested. Sesshomaru looked at him for a beat, and said quite cheerfully, ""I agree.

Act Six: Scene Three Joegore stood at the sparking and vibrating panel switches. On two tables in the center of the lab, connected by wires and tubes were dr. Yami and Inu-yasha. Yami""s plan was simple, to transfer his vast knowledge to Inu-yasha""s primitive brain, in order for him to function normally, and pass for human.

""You two lock all the doors and windows,"" Joegore said, ""Make sure they don""t get in."" The women nodded, and turned to go. But before she left, Kagome turned around and looked at Joegore.

2716,"Sensei, are the two of you really da-"" ""No, we aren""t."" Genos blinked. He expected that one. ""I see. Shall I incinerate the newspaper company?"" Saitama scratched his head. He had the same reaction as the midget. ""No need to, seriously. The media is always twisting stories so that it would sell, even to the point of creating a whole lie."" the bald hero said as he picked his nose. ""They should be taught a lesson for dirtying your name!"" the cyborg reasoned. Saitama could only sigh. ""Look, there are still plenty of newspaper companies all over the world. Destroying one wouldn""t make a difference. Sure, not all of them are completely bogus, but most of them are."" he said, hoping that Genos would understand so that they could stop talking about the stupid article. It was making his head ache. Fortunately for Saitama, Genos nodded in agreement. ""I guess you are right, sensei."" he responded before writing some new notes on his notebook. Genos remembered the time when Saitama defeated the Sea King. The bald hero never did care about his reputation, as long as he was able to contribute for the greater good. ""Ah, by the way, the supermarket opens at 8. I""m gonna get there at around 7 so that I could avoid the crowd."" Saitama said, as Genos nodded. ""Copy that."" the cyborg answered as he set up an internal alarm to wake up at exactly 6 am tomorrow. As the two heroes went back to their own businesses, a loud knock from the apartment""s door disturbed them. Saitama was about to get up reluctantly when Genos instantly stood up. ""It""s King-san, sensei."" he said as he walked towards the door and opened it. Saitama was a bit amazed with Genos"" ability. He realized how good Dr. Stench is. The moment the door opened, King instantly walked towards Saitama and held the hero by the shoulders. Somehow, he knew what King was going to say next. ""Saitama-bro. The article. Is it-"" ""Nope, it isn""t"" Saitama answered nonchalantly. He was getting tired of all these questions. He wouldn""t be surprised if Bang visited him to ask the same damn question. After a few seconds when King entered his apartment, another knock was heard. Genos opened the door once more to reveal Bang. Saitama wanted to slam his head on the table for even thinking about it. ""Saitama-"" ""Tatsumaki and I are not dating."" he said flatly, getting a bit annoyed now. On the other hand, the martial artist blinked. ""What are you talking about? I""m here to hand you your wagyu beef."" Bang said as he handed Saitama a paper bag. The hero could only mutter an ""oh"" as he accepted the said bag. ""Thanks man."" he said as he stood up and stored the beef in his refrigerator. ""So you two really aren""t dating-"" ""Good god, Bang. We are not. We""re friends. That""s it."" Saitama said. He should""ve known that Bang was informed about the article too. On the other hand, the older hero simply nodded. ""I see."" he muttered. ""You two are still getting to know each other. It""s a bit too fast if you two would be together-"" ""Let""s just drop the topic altogether, shall we?"" Saitama said as he went back to his manga.",2750536

733,"""Tch. Damn it. You just better or I""ll-"" Before he could ever finish, Kiku hanged up. He faced his troops. ""Yo guys! Japan had not surrendered yet. Please inform Arthur and Mac."" The soldiers agreed unto this. LATER~ ""Maaaaaaaaac! Artiiiiiiiiiiiiiiie! Aussiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiie! What""ll we do?"" Alfred whined while the three persons he mentioned looked at him. ""Fire the second bomb, right?"" Arthur reminded him with a hint of sarcasm. ""I know! But what if he does not surrender again?"" The three glared. ""Make another one, idiot!"" The three of them yelled in unison Alfred laughed nervously. ""Chill guys!"" He told the three glaring at him. ""We""ll give them two days."" MacArthur told Alfred who agreed with this. DAYS PASSED LOL~ ""He hasn""t surrendered yet!"" The American yelled at the Brit. Hurriedly, Arthur smacked him hard with a book he was reading. This caused Alfred to land flat on the ground. ""That hurts a lot, you know! You nearly destroyed my head!"" He said, trying to get up. Arthur glared back. ""So did my eardrums."" He replied with more anger showing. Returning to the plot, Arthur smacked his brother again. ""Ow! What was that for?"" Alfred said, while aiding his head. ""Attack Japan using the last atomic bomb you bloody git! Was that not your plan?"" He answered back, trying not to laugh while looking at the poor nation, massaging his head. Back on his serious mode, Alfred proudly said, ""Tomorrow, we drop fat man at Nagasaku!"" ""It""s ""Nagasaki"", Alfred."" Arthur corrected. ""Alright dude. Whatever."" *DRUMROLLS* THE DAY! NEXT DAY! ~ Alfred was looking down at Nagasaki, onboard his plane. ""Guys! We can drop it here!"" He signalled his troops. They dropped the hazardous bomb at Nagasaki now. Then a loud explosion was heard. Alfred shielded his eyes the moment he heard it. He called Kiku again, five minutes after the dropping of fat man. ""So what now?"" Kiku was still uncertain but on the other line, he""s facial expression was filled with anger, pain, worried, trauma and fright. His eyes were wide as saucers. Indeed he wanted to say ""Yes! So please don""t fire the bombs again!' Finally he closed his eyes then said, ""Yes, Amerika-san. I am officially giving up. Please don""t fire those bombs again."" Kiku said, the fear still clear in his voice. The moment Alfred heard this, only one thing came to his mind; World War Two has officially closed. But still, Clara was still in comatose. He smiled then replied, ""Great decision!"" Then he hanged up. The moment he planned to call Arthur for the good news, his phone rang. Coincidentally, it was Arthur. ""Yo?"" He greeted. ""Good news Alfred. This sure will blow your mind off of burgers."" Alfred laughed. ""Me too!"" The other nation sighed. ""I know. Kiku surrendered. World War Two has ended. NO need to tell me."" Alfred pouted. ""You kill joy you."" LATER~ Being a person who loves surprises, he hurriedly went to Arthur""s tent. ""Yo Artie! What do you-"" Alfred scanned the room but Arthur wasn""t there. Instead, a letter was found on his desk. ""Meet me on the bay. Your surprise lies there. Sincerely, Arthur Kirkland.",2750536
2667,"He couldn""t afford to break, and being around a man who had gone over an edge he spent his life in the after flirting with as much as a certain resident was making this the kind of dangerous mission he once loved. So Owen Hunt watched what he drank. After the Chief followed Shepherd inside the trailer, Owen knew it was time to leave. He looked at his watch for the first time since arriving and was immediately brought to his feet by the time. He""d already missed Sloan""s face transplant, and would soon miss Cristina""s solo surgery as well. Damn it. He looked at his drinking buddy for the past few hours, she was looking out into the woods with the dazed stupor only the drunk and high could pull off. ""Torres."" She kept the trance, so he took her arm. ""Callie, let""s go, give these two some space."" She looked at him now, though it took a few moments for her eyes to focus. ""What? I""m far too drunk to drive."" He began pulling her up and walking her to his truck. ""I""m not. I""ll give you a ride back to the hospital."" She frowned at her car, which had made him chuckle when he first pulled up. ""But my car..."" Owen opened the passenger door. ""I""ll be nice and give you a ride again tomorrow when you""re sober and you can pick it up."" He helped her into the truck like a true gentleman and she smiled at him. ""No wonder Yang""s sleeping with you."" Owen sighed. He tried to explain why he was naked in Cristina""s bed that morning without revealing any details, but it was useless. He closed her door and walked to the driver""s street. ""Bailey is looking at us."" Callie leaned in closer to the glass, trying to get a better look. ""Do you think that is a glare? I think she""s pissed."" ""I""m not looking at Bailey."" Callie glanced over at Owen, and it was true. His eyes were trained only on Cristina. If it hadn""t been for the booze, Callie might have been able to repress the eye roll, but really she should""ve known, it was nothing new. She looked at Bailey again. Bailey""s attention was no longer on the gallery; she was looking at Cristina with an unreadable look on her face. Alex looked like someone had just told him his favorite puppy hadn""t gone to a special puppy farm after all. Callie wondered what was going on down there. She wasn""t used to this perspective when it came to surgery. She felt like a spectator at a sporting event. As the surgery continued Callie began to grow bored. Why were they here? Cristina was rocking it out. Of course she was, she was Cristina freaking Yang. Her first solo surgery could""ve been nothing but a success. Callie knew it. Cristina knew it. Owen knew it. Everyone knew it. So, Callie did the same thing she did when she got bored at a sporting event. She rose from the seat she""d taken and began cheering and shouting. ""Go Cristina! Woah! Rock it out, Yang!"" Owen wasn""t watching Cristina anymore. He was trying to quiet Callie and to get her to sit back down again. Callie caught sight of Bailey""s eyes; she was definitely glaring now.",1497577

1406,"Its mighty branches supported the beautiful flowers. ""It is so nice, isn""t it?"" Hotohori walked beside Chidori. She blushed. ""It is,"" Chidori continued to stare at the tree, once in a while, stealing a glance at Hotohori. ""Chidori! Hotohori! Lunch is ready!"" Miaka called even they were only a few meters apart. ""We are only here, no need to shout,"" Hotohori said as he sat down opposite Nuriko. ""Because, it looks like you two are wandering somewhere..."" Miaka whispered to Chidori. Chidori blushed. ""It""s not that..."" Chidori said while Miaka just giggled. She sat down beside Nuriko, opposite Miaka and Tamahome. When everyone was settled, they started to eat. ""Itadakimasu!"" Numerous voices echoed through the air as they chat among each other. Chidori listened as Mitsukake lectured Tamahome on herbal medicines. Chiriko was having an argument with Chichiri on who will win the Soccer match that will be televised later in the evening. ""I think Hotohori likes you,"" Chidori was surprised to hear Nuriko""s voice. She turned to her. ""Of course not!"" Chidori defended, blushing in the same time. ""Aw come on! He""s looking at you...intently,"" Nuriko continued to tease Chidori. Nuriko was right. Out of the corner of Chidori""s eye, she saw that Hotohori was indeed looking at her. Her heart started to beat fast. ""You do make a cute couple..."" Nuriko said thoughtfully. ""Of course not!"" Chidori defended herself again. ""Really???"" ""Um..well...he""s good-looking, cute, kind and has that nice smile on his face...BUT were only friends!"" Chidori twirled her chopsticks. ""Aw! Say that again...after you are married,"" Nuriko giggled as she watched Chidori blush even more. ""We""re just friends!!!"" Everyone became silent as Chidori shouted, ""Ah...it""s nothing!!! hahaha!"" she covered Nuriko""s mouth when the latter attempted to say something. They continued what they were doing as Chidori sighed. She looked around and noticed something. ""Where is Tasuki?"" she asked the still laughing Nuriko. ""Not here. He is so stubborn, you know!"" Nuriko answered after regaining her composure. ""Because of me..."" Chidori whispered. ""AHHHHH!!!"" Suddenly, a figure fell down from the tree and landed flat on the ground. ""Omigosh! Is he still alive?! Help!! Call someone! Police! Doctor! Nurse! Any one!!"" Miaka panicked because the figure landed beside her. ""Tasuki? Are you alright?"" Tamahome approached the figure. ""Tasuki?"" the others also approached him. ""Ouch!"" Tasuki stirred and tried to get up but failed. ""We need to bring you to the hospital. I""ll call the ambulance,"" Mitsukake ran to the nearest phone booth. ""You have a wound!"" Chidori noticed a small cut in his arm. ""That""s nothing,"" Tasuki said as he snatched his arm from Chidori. ""Don""t be so stubborn!"" Chidori shouted. Tasuki just stared at her. She got her handkerchief and wrapped it in his wound. ""Tha...thank you..."" Chidori smiled as she heard Tasuki whisper those words. ""You broke about 3 bones in your ribs..."" Mitsukake concluded. He just finished calling, ""The ambulance will be here in a short while."" ----------------------- ""Yuuhi!",560480
141,"You may act like you don""t care, but we all can tell that you secretly do. You""ve always been there to listen to one of us rant even when you didn""t have to...even when we forgot you probably needed to as well. Hell! You practically saved my life the other day at work when I nearly grabbed the wrong thermos out of the fridge. God! Just thinking about drinking Miss. Noodles pee makes me want to vomit,"" Scott joked with a laugh, which quickly earned him one of my own. However, it seemed that wasn""t all of his speech, as he went on to say, ""But either way, if that doesn""t prove that you""re not a bad person then maybe this might. When Allison and I were having problems last year, and Stiles thought he was going to lose his mind running back and forth between us, you bought her a burner phone just because you thought that it might make things easier for us; not to mention the fact that you""d been saving that money for a new one yourself. Oh, and don""t think I""m going to forget that one about Jackson either. Even when none of us, but Lydia, could tolerate him and his constant bullying, you still tried to help him out in chemistry by not only giving him your notes, but forcing him to sit down with you as you went over them with him. I don""t think I""ve ever seen him so shocked in his life that someone wasn""t actually afraid of him, or intimidated by his insults. Yet you still tried, because you told him that if he didn""t man up, I""d be the least of his worries about staying on the Lacrosse field. Though, honestly, I think the most amazing feat out of all that is probably just you becoming friends with Stiles, and being able to keep up with his crazy little sarcasm day in and day out. Don""t get me wrong, I love Stiles like a brother, but I think you""re the only one who actually enjoys all of his jokes...and he""s had some pretty bad ones just so you know."" With glistening eyes, I couldn""t help but laugh at that last part, because one, Scott was right. Stiles might be a master at sarcasm, but sadly, when he did actually try to be funny it never really turned out that great in his favor. However, I think what probably shocked me the most about that, was just knowing how much I really did like him. I was willing to endure all of those horrible numbers just to see him smile even once. Yet, what probably actually floored me the most, was the sudden realization I had from the rest of his words. The ones where I realized just how much I cared for all of them in general; not just because they were some characters on a T.V. show. From the sounds of it (unintentionally, mind you), I was actually willing to go to these sort of extreme lengths just to make sure that none of them had to struggle any more than they already do. Tossing those thoughts back and forth inside my head, I felt the inner turmoil take over once more, but Scott was quick to quiet it once again with his next words as he reached out to place a gentle comforting hand upon my shoulder, ""But honestly, I just wish that you""d see that none of us here are pitying you.",806976
642,"""Now where""d you get that idea?"" Mitsuru laughed under his breath, smiling down at me, ""He absolutely adores you. You should""ve heard him go on about you when you graduated to SeeD on your first try!"" ""A-are we talking about the s-same man?"" Curse my stuttering... ""The headmaster of Balamb Garden, Alphonse Kramer, right?"" I nodded slightly and he smiled again, ""See? Sure, he may seem cold to you, but that""s only politics. He doesn""t want it to seem like he""s favoring you at all; but when it""s just him, me, and the other SeeD captains, you""re all he""ll talk about. Serious granddaughter complex, if you ask me."" ""Really?"" He laughed louder this time and I couldn""t help but giggle a bit myself. It was like his mirth was infectious; no wonder he was our leader, ""Yeah, that man""s crazy when he can actually be himself. But enough about Al, I want to know about you. Al and Heather have told me all about you."" ""H-Heather?"" I asked, puzzled. So he did know her, ""How do you know Heather?"" ""She""s the Sorceress-in-Training, remember?"" Mitsuru said as if I was missing something important. When I sat there, blinking stupidly, he sighed, ""I""m the SeeD Commander, she""s the next Sorceress. Get it yet?"" Then it hit me; of course they knew each other. A Sorceress always needs her knight to keep her sane. A knight to stand by her and protect her sanity so she won""t become Ultimecia. The position of knight customarily goes to the SeeD Leader. ""So... you""re is to be Heather""s Knight..."" I said slowly, looking down at the few little flowers. ""Yeah..."" Did he sound somehow... regretful? I looked up at him, tilting my head to the side slightly. Shouldn""t he be happy to be the Knight? He would have an easy life then, together with his Sorceress. ""You know... if it was my choice, I wouldn""t be the leader at all."" ""What?"" My eyes widened and I quickly swung around, making sure no one was around to hear what he just said. The SeeD Leader doesn""t want to be the leader? But Mitsuru was a great leader... we haven""t lost a single SeeD since he was in charge. And he would be the Sorceress""s Knight, the greatest position next to the SeeD Leader. He would be both, and was a Leonhart to boot! The Leonharts... the blood of the great heroes Squall and Rinoa run through his veins... why wouldn""t he want this? Mitsuru""s smile began to grow a sad edge, ""I don""t want to be the leader. All the pressure... all the bullshit politics, all this predestined, ""Fated Children"" crap... it""s not what I want."" He sighed and laid back in the grass, staring up at the cloudless sky, ""I don""t know why I""m telling you this. Maybe it""s because I feel like I already know you so well from Heather and Headmaster Alphonse. They both know how I feel about the whole thing. I just want to be free, but this name... Leonhart, it traps me. Traps me in a cage where all the important decisions about my life are made for me. You ever feel like that?"" I shook my head. Honestly, I though it would be great to be in his position. To be the leader of such a noble, powerful, amazing group such as SeeD, ""I don""t get it.""",748687
3701,"""That doesn""t count. You have to say it."" ""I swear, Akito-sama. When did you want to start?"" ""Tonight. It has to be at night or someone will notice something""s different."" He tossed the covers aside, briefly shivering as he squirmed his way to the edge of the bed. ""Bring me that robe-it""s freezing in here."" She got a dark blue robe off the back of a chair and helped him get it on. When he was no longer shaking so much, she took his hands and placed them on her shoulders. Then, she put her hands on his sides. ""I""m going to back straight up,"" she warned him, ""which is going to pull you up. Even if you start to fall, don""t panic. I""ll be able to catch you this way."" He wrinkled his nose in disgust. It looked a little like they were about to start dancing, but if this was the only way, so be it. She pulled him upright and filled her promise of not letting him fall. It was awkward and hard-his feet were splayed apart the way a toddler""s would be and his knees were shaking. She helped him correct his posture. ""Now, when I move my foot back, you move yours forward, okay?"" What he ended up doing was more shuffling than walking. It was the first time most of his muscles had ever done any real work, so he tired out very quickly. They""d only made it from one end of the bed to the other and back before he had to stop and rest. ""Ow,"" he complained, ""I""ll be glad when it doesn""t hurt."" ""That goes away with practice, kind of like how I used to ache all over when I was climbing trees,"" Tohru confided in him, ""and I stopped falling out of them, too."" At the image of her falling on her butt in the grass, Akito chuckled darkly. ""I wish I could have seen it."" ""Did Okami say you could come outside tomorrow?"" Tohru asked. ""No, but she hasn""t said no either,"" Akito said, ""if I could just keep from getting sick again for a while, I could probably go out all the time."" He was panting from exertion now and it was harder to keep him upright. It wasn""t long before they had to call it quits and go to bed for real. Tohru smoothed his covers over him; Akito was already having trouble keeping his eyes open. She noticed the box that Isuzu had tried to take from him on the nightstand. ""Akito...what""s in that box?"" ""Nothing,"" he slurred, voice becoming heavy with sleep. ""Then why is it so important?"" ""Because."" ""Because?"" ""It just is. Like how your name is just Tohru."" She shrugged. ""Okay...good night, then."" The next morning, she woke to a great deal of chaos. Akito was clearly upset about something-she heard a lot of shouting followed by a very big crash. The heavy dark fog of sleep battled with the adrenaline being pumped into her veins. ""Kagura? What""s going on?"" she asked stupidly as Kagura all but exploded into the room. ""Akito won""t let us get near him,"" she sighed, ""I thought since you two were getting along so good that you could try to calm him down."" Tohru stumbled after Kagura, still not fully awake yet. By the time she saw Akito, she was.",870118

The last part of the pictorial will now begin!"" Sebastian announced. Everyone sat back to his or her seats, waiting in anticipation.What is Maya""s secret weapon...?Oh, you""ll see in a few seconds.The curtains opened as the background changed again. It was now a beach.Could it be that..?Yuta was standing on the stage; all spotlights were focused on him. His current attire is what caught the attention of the audience.Bikini.Yup, Kirishima Yuta is wearing a bikini.The bikini was pink in color, simple but it appealed.Different reactions were again heard from the audience. ""Yuta is in a bikini... waaah! He""s soooo cute!"" Mito squealed. ""Is Yuta really a girl...?"" Nina whispered. ""Could I ask how did he achieve his chest?"" Tsujiai mused.""Tsujiai?!"" Kaji and the prince chorused. They looked at their friend disbelievingly. Tsujiai is so suspicious, very suspicious...""It looks so real..."" Ayu suddenly added. ""Yuta looks nice on that bikini,"" Mikami-sensei said thoughtfully. ""Where did he get the bikini?"" Rio asked.""GAK! I now remember why those dresses are familiar,"" Luna suddenly said. They looked at her curiously. ""What do you mean? """"Those clothes, including that bikini, were Maya""s,"" answered Luna. Everyone""s attention turned to Maya.""Maya""s?!"" Everyone except for Sebastian, Luna and Maya chorused.""So?"" Maya said- her tone was not carrying any emotion at all.""So?! They are yours!"" Mikami-sensei blurted out.""So? """"How can you let Yuta wear them?"" Tsujiai rephrased Mikami-sensei""s comment. ""Why not? I do not wear such clothes, for Pete""s sake!"" Maya answered as she flipped her hair. ""Poor clothes..."" Nina said.""Maya-chan!"" Yuta ran to them. ""This bikini is totally amazing! It""s so cute! I""m telling you, you have a very good sense of fashion! """"Not really, Yuka-chan,"" she tuck a loose strand behind his ear. ""Anyway, we should get this done before the Jusenkyo Potion loses its effect,"" she said as she and Yuta made their way to the stage.Nina giggled while Tsujiai had a thoughtful look on his face. It seems Maya is comfortable with gay-type Yuta. Hmm... The theory of putting the two is possible, very possible. ""I wonder how the TRUE Yuta would react when he learns that there was a part in his life where he has done two things no one could imagine he""ll do: first, cross-dressing, second: being cozy with Orihara,"" Kaji mused while Mito giggled like crazy. ""I would love to see his reaction,"" Rio snickered.----------------------------As the sun continued to set, the lone figure suddenly collapsed in the dry road.""I... I.... can""t give up!

1770,"Butch drove his fist into the punching bag and kept going, his mind heavy. Next to him, BC was practicing roundhouse kicks on a similar punching bag decorated with Princess""s face. ""I wonder what the others are doing..."" Butch said. ""Probably getting all mushy and gross... Stringing pretty words through each others"" to lull them to sleep... That crap."" ""Yeah..."" Sounded about right. ""What wimps. Right?"" Butch laughed. The pounding from the Princess punching bag stopped. He looked over to see BC staring at the ground. Sh**, what had he said now?!

And Princess can""t handle us, no way no how."" He gave her a kiss on the cheek. ""Now let""s get back to punching."" She squeezed his hand tighter. ""Wait...""

AK: This chapter is devoid of true action ""action"", but it""s got plenty of emotion. Plenty... Even the greens got gushy... So yeah, I wanna hear suggestions about which stories to make a sequel for so... R&R please! Chapter 2 Buttercup jogged through the downtown neighborhood, while in her ears blared a KISS song twice her age. Her all black Converse beat the pavement in rapid succession. She threw out punches at the air, her green-taped fists pummeling an unforeseen enemy. She drove home the hits faster than Major Glory (she knew because they""d once again had a little ""girls versus boys"" contest). She barely panted even after her swift flying endurance drill. ""Stupid dinner date..."" she lashed out again, this time breaking a lamp post. Her fist left a perfect imprint in the metal pole. ""Stupid neighbors,"" she added. She didn""t like going to her neighbors"" houses. After the Smith family fiasco, she barely liked talking with them. She delivered a roundhouse kick to the metal. ""Stupid Bubbles, picking out clothes...taking stupid measurements,"" Buttercup growled, letting her fists to annihilate the pole. Breathing harder, she finally continued on her jog, leaving the mutilated pole behind. On the corner, she switched to another rock song. She came to a full stop by a basketball court.",3439302
2846,"Well, today might be the day, so I should at least conserve some energy. Who knows how tiring will it be to tell your actual feelings to a person? I went up to the clubroom, which is just as tiring, and entered. Inside were Satoshi and Chitanda... weird, because it""s usually Satoshi and Ibara or Chitanda and Ibara. So... where is she? ""Good afties, Houtarou!"" Satoshi greeted, as energetic as ever. I wonder how much energy he saves up just by sleeping during the night. I just can""t fathom that. I greeted back, and then sat down on a chair. Chitanda was just sitting there, as if waiting for someone. I observed her for a while. It was unusual of her to be not talking right now. Usually, she has another activity or mystery for us. Usually, for me. But right now... she isn""t even moving from her position. I am getting so tempted to ask her if everything is al- ""I am sorry I am late everyone! I tried to skip Library duties today!"" Ibara said, catching her breath and completely tired. Satoshi and Chitanda welcomed her, and then she sat down near Satoshi. ""So, um... Chi-chan! Can we talk for a sec? Just the two of us?"" ""Uh... um... yes, Mayaka-san!"" The two were talking as if they had a script to memorize. They went out of the room and had their private conversation. Girls... I can never understand them. ""So, have you planned what you""re gonna tell her?"" I shifted my eyes at him, with my eyebrows crossed. ""I haven""t got any. Don""t you do this stuff spontaneously?"" I replied. Satoshi chuckled, and then patted my back. ""Clearly, this is your first time. Where have you learned such wisdom, mangas?"" I gave him an irritated glare. ""My sister."" ""That""s Tomoe-neesan for you!"" he said with a soft laugh. I transferred my gaze on the table, and then rested my head on my palm. ""I don""t know how I""ll start. Where should I begin? What should I say first?"" I gave out a long sigh. ""Romance is just so tiring."" ""You""re just you being you. It""s not as tiring as it seems! If you love what you""re doing, then you""ll definitely never grow tired of doing it!"" Really, huh? ""Maybe... I should just tell her how I really feel. Directly."" I told myself. Well, I haven""t really noticed that I said that one out loud. Satoshi gave out a dramatic gasp. Kind of exaggerated, actually. ""Is that you, Houtarou?"" ""Shut up."" Before he could say anything, the girls went back in. Ibara seems to be satisfied and proud while Chitanda was looking... confused or something. Satoshi stood up, and then got his bag. ""I am off! See you guys tomorrow... I have to finish my report for the Student Council. Bye-bye!"" He walked out, leaving me with the two girls. Feeling a bit awkward, I got my book and pretended to read it. This isn""t going anywhere at all! Well, today might not be the day anyway. Ibara and Chitanda talked like little girls, or at least that""s all I can hear. I felt my eyelids were starting to fall. My vision started to be blurry and unfocused... And before I know it, I fell... a... sleep... ... ... ... Eh? Where... am I? I opened my half opened eyes then rubbed them.",2750536
602,"The thick cables were cold and dead and the red stones were fully dissolved. All in the room were quiet except for number Twelve. God, he felt like he had a trillion ccs of adrenaline in his blood. No, he felt like he had blood in his adrenaline. Growling like a rabid animal, he flexed his arms and the synth-leather straps broke like cotton candy. He threw himself off the operating table with shaky legs. He was still getting used to this new rage and power but he knew what he wanted to do-kill! As he stumbled towards the Contra Mundi and followers, Cain raised his hand and spoke a single word. ""Stay."" The effect was instant; number Twelve froze like a glacier. The programming was flawless; he would be powerless before the Contra Mundi""s commands. Yet there was one other effect felt. His missing eye had grown back, but much superior. He could see everything-including him. There was one more person in the operating theater than there started out. It was very suddenly that number of people had increased by one, but more shockingly to twelve it was who this new person was. It was him! A man stood in the alchemic array who looked exactly like Fuhrer Candidate number Twelve. They had the same hair color, same eye color and the even had identical ultimate eyes. Even the placement of hair follicles on their scalps was the same. The sole difference lay in the raised red wires and strange buttons imbedded into his skin along his arms and shoulders. The new homunculus who stood in the alchemic array sneered. He was sneering at number twelve, at the gold toothed Doctor, the Contra Mundi-hell, he was probably sneering at the world itself with unbridled pride. Number twelve looked at the homunculus who""d been born from his eye and utterly hated him at first sight. ""Pride,"" Cain lazily ordered, ""Kill Wrath."" Pride did not need any prompting. With speed and agility reaching insane levels, he sprinted across the room and began to rip open Wrath""s throat with his teeth. Surprised, number Twel-no-Wrath tried to push his twin brother off him as he bit through the major arteries. Blood gushed everywhere, not in arterial spurts but in one steady stream. Slamming the palms of his hands onto his brother""s ears, Wrath ruptured his brother""s eardrums and pulled back. Almost instantly, the blood stopped and red sparks flew as the wounds healed. As Pride held his damaged ears, Wrath did not wait. He kicked his brother as hard as he could in the groin and then kicked him once more; bone shattered and Pride bent over. Using that to his advantage, Wrath slammed his knee as hard as he could into Pride""s face; the other homunculus went flying back. Pride however rapidly rebounded and jumped onto his brother. Head-butting Wrath three times in the nose, the two homunculi fought like rabid animals. Wrath reached up and hooked his finger into Pride""s mouth, ripping open his twin""s cheek in a hideous Glasgow grin. Pride grabbed wrath and impaled him on a coat hanger, grabbed an overturned chair and began to hit his twin as hard as he could with it.",1220273
299,"""You said that an hour ago,"" Skye complained, kicking off her shoes and massaging her swollen ankles. ""Yeah, but I mean it this time. I have a really good feeling about his dress."" ""You said that an hour ago, too,"" Lily grumbled, resting her head back on the chair and closing her eyes. ""Don""t you go falling asleep on me now,"" Skye warned Lily, and her eyes instantly shot open. Evil Skye had convinced them to go dress shopping that day for the ball. Lily and Skye found their dresses in the first shops, but Maddy had dragged them to every boutique in the colony and Skye and Lily were exhausted, irritated and extremely fed up. Whatever excitement they had felt for the ball had been drained from their systems as Maddy tried on dress after dress. And if Lily heard Maddy""s irritating squeals one more time, she would... ""Oooh, I love it!"" Maddy shrieked. ""Okay, here""s the plan,"" Skye whispered to Lily. ""If she walks out of there looking like a meringue pie sitting on a bicycle pump we are going to tell her she looks beautiful."" ""Oh, Skye, we can""t do that!"" Lily giggled. ""Oooh, wait till you see!"" Maddy shrieked again. ""On second thought..."" Lily looked at Skye miserably. ""Okay, are you ready?"" ""Yes,"" Skye groaned unenthusiastically. ""Ta-da!"" She stepped out of the dressing room and Lily""s eyes widened. ""Oh, that""s so beautiful on you!"" gushed the sales assistant who had been hovering nearby. ""Oh, stop it!"" Maddy cried. ""You""ve liked every single one of them."" Lily looked at Skye uncertainly and tried not to laugh at the look on her face; she looked like someone had passed gas. ""Oh, do you like it?"" Maddy squealed. ""Yes,"" Skye said flatly. ""Are you sure?"" ""Yes."" ""Do you think Mark will be happy when he dances with me?"" Maddy even practiced ballroom dancing just so the girls could imagine it. ""Yes,"" Skye repeated. ""Are you sure?"" ""Yes."" ""Do you think it""s worth the money?"" ""Yes."" ""Really?"" ""Yes."" ""Oh, but does it make my butt look enormous?"" ""Yes."" Lily looked at Skye startled, realizing she wasn""t even listening to the questions anymore. ""Oh, but are you sure?"" Maddy carried on, obviously not listening to the answers. ""Yes."" ""So will I get it?"" Lily half-expected the sales assistant to start jumping up and down with excitement screaming ""Yessss!"" but she managed to contain herself. ""No!"" Lily interrupted before Skye said yes again. ""No?"" Maddy asked. ""No,"" Lily confirmed. ""Do you not like it?"" ""No."" ""Is it because it makes me look fat? ""No."" ""Do you not think Mark will like it?"" ""No."" ""Do you think it""s worth the money, though?"" ""No."" ""Oh."" She turned to face Skye. ""Do you agree with Lily?"" ""Yes."" ""Okay then, I trust you two,"" Maddy said, taking a last look at herself in the mirror. ""To be honest I wasn""t really that keen on it myself."" Skye sighed and put her shoes back on. ""Okay, Maddy, you said that was the last one. Let""s go get something to eat before I drop dead."" ""No, I meant it was the last dress I would try on in this shop. There""s loads more shops to go to."" ""No way!"" Lily protested.",2855986
1833,"Review and read :D Have fun! Ta Master of the Boot All the Pretty Things: Strangled at birth Bonus chapter part 2: Nuremberg 2.0 Warning: This chapter contains horror and Alucard being a bastard. Seriously, he""s not nice in this; I""m talking about Adolf Hitler type mean. This chapter also contains Alucard dressing stylish. Seras stood on stage before hundreds of Alucard""s servants. Among them were the No-Life King""s soldiers, assassins, torturers, scientists, craftsmen and butchers. Each one of them was more deviant than the last. Living for a full century under Alucard, his servants had grown progressively more brutal and cruel. New vampires created under Alucard""s reign generally did not know of the honour and respect shared by the older vampires. The only rule that they followed was that Alucard""s word was iron. Everyone was screaming and shouting madly. ""Boss! Boss! Give us the boss!"" It was like a football chant that they kept on repeating. Where is the boss! Show us the boss! Boss! Boss! Give us the boss! Dressed in her slutty police girl""s outfit, Seras hated every last one of them. Part of her wanted to run when Drusilla said to, but truthfully there was no place that she could run to. There was also the fear that if she ran, Alucard would find her and make her pay. Maybe he wouldn""t find her in America; but he""d heard enough propaganda about John Farson and the other vampire rebel leaders on various continents to fear travelling anywhere abroad. She""d planned plenty of public announcements for Alucard, but this was the first time she would be actually taking part in it. During the last two public spectacles she""d been buried alive and hadn""t had the chance to watch the show. Feeling naked and nervous before the crowd, Seras wishes that the microphone in her hand was a gun and that she could blow off all their heads in a messy explosion. Since her feelings were completely irrelevant to anything, she held the microphone close to her mouth and began the ceremony. ""HALLO EVERYBODY!"" Seras shouted with glee that she did not feel. Her smile was bright and plastic. Her teeth shone and the outfit she wore showed off enough cleavage that she even wished she was wearing her marginally less skimpy uniform. This blue outfit showed off even more than her tan one. No doubt this was done intentionally by Alucard who knew that the affairs of state were less important to the peasants than boobies and booze. Immediately the tumult of the crowd went down but did not completely subside. They wanted to see their king! ""I""d just like to welcome everyone to another State of the Nation address by our own kind and benevolent sacred ancestor."" At the mention of Alucard, everybody cheered and shouted. Seras smiled and went on. ""There will be music and entertainment and the faithful will show their worth by denouncing traitors along with public executions with audience participation."" This evoked even more cheering and hollering. This was the mob, but unlike Caesar, there was no senate to hold back Alucard""s will.",1220273
2090,"""What if the light blinds me? Or the sun burns me?"" ""We""ll have to get you used to the light,"" Tohru said, ""it""s always so dark in here...we should take the shades off and let some sunlight in. You""ll feel better just seeing it."" A clap of thunder made them both jump. Tohru giggled, but Akito seemed to pale even more. ""It""s only thunder,"" she told him, ""it means there""s a storm going on outside."" ""I know what a storm is,"" Akito said irritably, though he had yet to see one. Tohru examined the window coverings. ""This doesn""t look too hard to get off,"" she said, ""maybe you can watch the lightning."" Tugging at them furiously, she managed to pry them off one by one. Not a moment too soon, either-the night was a light show. At first, Akito hid his face from the blinding blue-white lightning and trembled. ""It""s all right! Mom said it was just a bunch of really hot air running into really cool air,"" she explained, putting her arm around his shoulders, ""and that loud bang was the air expanding when the lightning heats it up."" Slowly, his fear gave way to curiosity. He watched the rain drip down the glass like thousands of people crying all at once. It was still very scary to a person who""d never seen it, especially when the wind blew tree branches and leaves against the glass, but it was still something new to look at after all this time. Tohru helped him into his chair (almost dumping him in the floor by accident) and wheeled him over to the windows. After a little while, the storm gave way to a steady rain. With the shades off the windows, he could actually hear the rain better, too. The thousands of taps were almost soothing. ""Go to bed now,"" he told her, ""I want to go out tomorrow and I""m going to need your help to do it."" The morning routine mostly went the same. Breakfast, dress, outside. While Okami was slightly worried about the windows being uncovered, Akito insisted that she leave them alone. He ate his breakfast while watching a handful of birds fluttering around and looking for their own food. He gazed at the bright colors with such intensity that his vision lost focus a few times. It""s so bright...like a painting...I wonder if I""ll ever be colored like that... In the bold light of the morning sun, his reflection seemed paler than ever. The blue-black seemed to have been washed from his hair and the dark sapphire mixed with gray gone from his eyes. His skin was as pale as white marble. When Kagura came for his breakfast tray, he demanded one of his yukatas and that she help him to his chair. Thankfully, she didn""t ask millions of questions or fuss like Okami did. There was only one and it was spoken with a slight smile: ""Feeling better, Akito-sama?"" He nodded as she smoothed the yukata down over his legs. Annoyingly, he seemed to have lost more weight recently despite his best efforts to eat more. It kept slipping down his shoulders, but he ignored it. He had better things to worry about. Meanwhile, Tohru was trying to recruit some help in transporting him out of the house.",870118
2325,"Now that he had a plan, Bruce removed his hands from his head and said, ""I need to get out of Gotham."" He looked up at his former protégé, ""Would you like to come with?"" Dick was shocked. Not just by Bruce admitting he needed a vacation, but that he""d been asked to accompany him on said vacation. His answer was almost automatic. ""Sure."" Now that a plan was in place, something deep inside of Bruce settled. ""I""ll make the arrangements. I""m thinking Tokyo first."" Bruce threw his legs off the bed, but kept the sheets around his waist, looking at Dick expectantly. But Dick was still too deep in shock to pick up on the prompt. So Bruce said, ""Dick, I""m naked under this sheet, and need a shower. You""re in my way, and I doubt you want to stay."" Yeah, Dick definitely didn""t want to see anything under the sheet. He hastily removed himself. Selina loved Gotham. The city had a heartbeat and a feeling that was unique to any other place in the world. Its citizens were just as unique, for better or worse. It was her home in every sense of the word. God, she would miss it. Ted Grant returned from the bathroom, as soon as he sat again he looked at the key she""d pushed across the table to him once again. He picked up the conversation from where they""d left it. ""Now let me see if I""ve got this straight. You""re giving me the key to your paid for penthouse because you""re leaving Gotham."" Selina was slightly annoyed by his disbelief. ""I didn""t realize moving was such a difficult concept for you, Ted."" ""I don""t believe it."" He slapped his hand on the table, drawing the attention of some of the more cultured patrons, and Selina thought she should""ve picked a less upscale restaurant for this as she briefly scanned the crowd for familiar faces. ""I just don""t fucking believe it."" ""It""s happening whether you believe it or not."" Selina smiled and Ted was as charmed by it as any breathing man. ""Well, I don""t want your place. It""s too rich for my humble and rough tastes."" Surprisingly Selina didn""t put up a fight, which made Ted suspect that she""d been planning for this to be his reaction from the start. ""Fair enough. Then just make sure no one goes into it and feed my cat for the time being."" Ted wondered if any of this had anything to do with Batman""s recent disappearance. The Dark Knight hadn""t been spotted in Gotham for over a month now. But he pushed the thought aside. ""Where are you going?"" Selina glanced at the surrounding crowd again. Jesus, she was getting as paranoid as Bruce. ""I think the less you know, the better."" Ted sat in disbelief for a moment more before slapping the table again, ""Well then, this calls for a drink."" He grabbed the passing waiter. ""Two glasses of your finest scotch for me and the lady."" Selina instructed, ""Just one glass, but I""ll take another lemon water."" The waiter nodded and went off to fetch their drinks, but Ted wore a confused expression on his face. ""Since when do you not drink scotch?"" Selina evaded the question, ""Since when do you care about my drinking habits?"" The waiter had returned with their drinks and Selina thanked him.",1497577
2257,"""If only Tamura-sensei and I were like that..."" Mikami-sensei sighed. An image of him chasing Tamura-sensei flashed in his mind. The palm trees, the setting sun...oh so romantic! ""If only that woman fall from heaven."" Mikami-sensei wondered loudly. ""AHHHHH!!!!!!"" A voice rang through the air. Mikami-sensei""s eyes widened from what he saw. A woman falling from the sky. Instinctively, he opened his arms and tried to catch her. ""I""ll catch you! I""ll catch you! I""ll-"" The woman fell at him. ""Ouch! That was a soft landing"" The woman exclaimed. Her eyes widened when she saw that she was sitting on a man. ""I""m so sorry!!! I can explain myself!"" The lady helped Mikami-sensei up. Mikami-sensei was utterly speechless. The lady was so beautiful. Is that what they call love at first sight?, he thought. ""Um..excuse me?"" The lady inquired. Mikami-sensei was staring at her. It made her feel nervous ""Oh, sorry. Um...what""s you name? Why are you here?"" Mikami-sensei couldn""t help asking too much. ""My name is Kirishima Mito."" She bowed. ""I am here because I want to see my brother."" ""Kirishima?"" Mikami-sensei thought for a while. ""As in Kirishima Yuta?"" ""Yes. Do you know him, Mikami-sensei? "" She smiled. ""Um..yes. Hey! How did you know my name?"" Mikami-sensei asked. ""It is written on your pen. Here."" Mito gave Mikami-sensei his pen. ""Ah..well, you see, this is a gift from a friend."" Mikami-sensei scratched his head. ""Anyway, could you please help me? I need to speak to the Orihara""s. Maybe they could let me stay with my brother here. Being at home is so boring."" Mito asked. ""Of course!"" Mikami-sensei smiled. He has found her. ""Okay. I""m again lost."" Kaji said. He was trying to find his way to the dinning room. It was almost lunch. ""Are you Kaji-kun?"" A voice interrupted his thoughts. He turned to find the servant from last night. ""Um..yes. Are you Tateishi Ayu?"" Kaji asked. She is so beautiful. Her hair""s so nice, he thought. ""Yes. Do you want me to lead you to the dinning room?"" She smiled warmly. ""uh...yes please."" Kaji answered. ""Please follow me."" Ayu led the way. The trip to the dinning room was silent. Kaji was busy looking at Ayu while Ayu was busy stealing glances on Kaji. At last, they reached the dinning room. ""Here we are."" Ayu opened the doors for Kaji. Kaji took Ayu""s hand. He kissed it. That gesture made Ayu blush furiously. ""Thank you, my dear lady."" Kaji said in his ""gentleman"" manner. ""It""s...nothing. I""m a servant here so you don""t need to be so respectful."" Ayu said as she tried to speak calmly. ""It""s just you""re so kind that you are worthy of it..not that the others are not worth it."" Kaji smiled. It made Ayu blush even more, if it was possible. ""See you again, Tateishi."" Kaji walked inside. Ayu stood there for a while. Just then, a voice interrupted her thoughts. She shivered. Is it her or the air became rather cold? ""Good for you. I hope the prince will treat me that way too."" Luna muttered. She smiled bitterly at Ayu. ""Luna-sama."" Ayu bowed. Her aura""s so dark and cold, she thought. ""No need to place the '-sama"". Why am I so unlucky?",560480
1171,"Biff noticed that both Marty and Elle were staring, openmouthed. ""What are you looking at, buttheads?"" ""Hey, get a load of this guy""s life preserver,"" a boy said, grabbing Marty""s jacket. ""Dork thinks he""s gonna drown."" ""Look at that girl""s pants!"" Another said. ""Hey, chick, are you wearing your father""s pants or what?"" Elle remembered that girls weren""t supposed to wear jeans in the 50""s. She blushed and looked down at the tiled floor. Biff returned to the two boys. ""So how about our homework?"" ""Okay, Biff. We""ll finish that tonight and we""ll bring it first thing tomorrow morning, okay,"" Phelan replied, using the same dorky laugh Mcfly had. ""Not too early, I sleep in Sundays. Oh, Phelan, your shoe""s untied!"" When Phelan looked down Biff smacked his jaw. ""Don""t be so gullible, Phelan."" ""Okay,"" He laughed again. ""Remember, I don""t want to see you buttheads in here again."" Biff turned to leave, bringing his cronies with him. ""Okay. Alright. Bye bye,"" Mcfly said before turning back to his breakfast. Marty and Elle stared at their fathers, wide-eyed. They edged closer and closer to the real thing, each hardly daring to believe it- Mcfly slammed his spoon down into his bowl, clearly uncomfortable. ""What?"" Marty blinked. ""You""re George Mcfly,"" he croaked. ""And you- you""re Daniel Phelan,"" Elle said to Phelan. ""Yeah. That""s us. Who are you?"" Daniel replied. Elle was about to answer before a tall African-American boy stuck his head in the conversation. ""Say, why do you let those boys push you guys around like that for?"" he drawled. He was wearing a white shirt, white apron, and a white cap was balanced on his head. ""Well, they""re bigger than us,"" Daniel answered, pulling out his wallet. ""Yeah, if we fight back, they""ll hurt us,"" George agreed. ""Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. Don""t you know, if you let people walk over you now, they""ll be walking over you for the rest of your life. Look at me. You think I""m gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?"" ""Watch it Goldie,"" the man behind the counter said. Goldie? ""No sir! I""m gonna make something of myself. I""m going to night school, and one day, I""m gonna be somebody."" ""That""s right!"" Marty blurted out. ""He""s gonna be mayor!"" Goldie grinned in a dreamy sort of way at Marty, revealing a gold front tooth. ""Mayor!"" Clearly the idea had never occurred to him. ""Now that""s a good idea! I could run for mayor!"" ""A colored mayor, that""ll be the day,"" the old man said as he walked by, toting a broom. ""You wait and see, Mr. Curuthers, I will be mayor. I""ll be the most powerful man in Hill Valley, and I""m gonna clean up this town."" ""Good. You can start by sweeping the floor."" The man, Mr. Caruthers, handed Goldie the broom. Goldie just stood there and smiled. ""Mayor Goldie Wilson. I like the sound of that."" He picked up the empty dishes left by Daniel and George as he walked by. Marty was about to take a sip from his coffee before he realized that the two boys were gone. He slammed down his cup, slopping coffee everywhere.",2855986
156,"""Really now, I thought you were the only weird one, Hino, playing Chopin in the violin."" ""Don""t worry Kahoko-dear, nothing""s wrong with that,"" Hamai Misa said with a smile. ""I""ve heard similar versions before and I must say they were very beautiful. I know you""ll do well, if not better."" Her cheeks colored at the optimism the world-renowned pianist gave her. ""I--I""m not that good-- Tsukimori-kun is so much better,"" she mumbled to which Tsukimori coughed. ""Have more confidence in yourself, Kahoko-dear,"" Hamai Misa urged. ""I""ve heard you play before and I must say you play so beautifully."" If possible, she blushed deeper. Tsukimori, noticing how flattered Kahoko was, cleared his throat. ""Mother, don""t you think we should begin now?"" ""Wait-- begin what?"" Kahoko asked as Hamai Misa handed the music sheet to her son who placed it on the stand. ""Practice, of course."" ""Yes, but I mean--"" Kahoko glanced at the older woman who positioned her hands on the piano keys. ""I""m accompanying you for practice today,"" she answered at the questioning look of the female violinist. ""Since you""ve played this piece before, I thought you could already start practicing with the piano."" The last time I played this piece perfectly was in the concours with the help of Lily""s magic! ""Wait! C--Can I practice without the piano first? I mean,"" mind panicking, Kahoko turned to Tsukimori, ""it""s really been a long time and uhm.. I can""t remember everything, right Tsukimori-kun?"" The male in question sighed. ""She does have a point, mother. We might just waste your time if we stop due to mistakes."" Kahoko felt a pang of hurt at the obvious criticism. ""I suppose,"" Hamai Misa assessed slowly as she closed the lid of the piano. ""Very well, I expect you to guide her well, Len,"" she told her son as she moved towards the door and added, ""don""t push yourself too hard, Kahoko-dear."" Kahoko exhaled audibly when the door closed. She almost humiliated herself in front of the Hamai Misa! How awful it would be that a world-renowned pianist who had been so kind to accompany her for practice would see how clumsy she was of a violin player. And Hamai Misa had been very optimistic. She felt a growing uneasiness in her stomach. True, there were times that she played Chopin""s etude no.3 opus 10 even after Lily""s magic vanished. But it never felt the same as during the first selection. It felt as if something was missing. Glancing at the male violinist beside her, she groaned inwardly. This was going to be a long practice indeed. If Tsukimori Len was to assess Hino Kahoko""s playing, he would say that she really was improving. She hit the notes correctly-well, a little sloppily in some phrases-but still correctly. She was following each crescendo and decrescendo religiously, and her timing was almost perfect. This was why he could not understand why her shoulders slumped in disappointment as the last note reverberated from the violin. She sighed as she lowered the instrument. He didn""t really care, and yet-""what""s wrong?""",560480
423,"So Him beats Clay with his belt and everytime he does Clay remembers the times he mistreats Orel, puts up with his abusive father Arthur Puppington and remembers... his deceased mother Angela Puppington. Meanwhile, Orel just happens to be in the blacklist woods and can see from a distance just what is happening in Moralton. Orel then prays to God and says, ""God if this is the rapture please take me with you... or at least send the devil away...or summon those super powered girls from that one town. Orel hears no reponse and is rather sad. Then from out of the distance Doughy runs to Orel and says, ""Yikes Orel! You""re not wearing clothes, many of the people think God claimed you...here, I brought you your Judas costume from that school play from last year."" Doughy hums the song ""I hate you Jesus"" from that play. Orel then says, ""Thanks but I think it really is the end, there is no hope nor prayer that can get rid of the devil. But I""m glad I wasn""t in town when he showed up!"" The red mist materialized and a reptilian monster appears. Orel tried to run away but he trips and his ""lucky bottle of holy water"" falls on the monster, melting him away into nothingness.

Orel continues, ""Ok Doughy, I guess it would be up to ALL of us to stop ""HIM"" from destroying everything and everyone we love and I know God and Jesus would protect me..""

610,"""Hi,"" Elska chirped, putting out her hand, ""Nice to meet you."" ""Humph!"" Gem grunted, crossing her arms. ""Did I do something wrong?"" Elska asked, looking quite sad. ""You must forgive the Princess, she""s mute,"" Ryna said, ""and she doesn""t take to new faces all that well."" ""Princess,' Magnus asked Gem in her mind, ""What""s wrong?' ""Nothing!' Gem yelled in her head. ""Absolutely nothing!' ""But... Oh! You think-! Gem, she""s like my baby sister! There""s nothing going on between us. I haven""t seen her in two years. That""s all.' ""Okay... I""m sorry,' Gem smiled again, and took Magnus""s arm. ""It""s just hard for me to see you paying so much attention to another girl. Specially knowing how I feel about you.' ""It""s alright now,"" Magnus said out loud. ""Elska, it""s okay. Gem""s sorry for being a little rude."" ""It""s fine,"" Elska said, ""But I need to ask you something. What was that with those dragons before?"" ""They kidnapped Leaf,"" Maar said. ""And there""s more of them!"" They all looked up into the skies. Lightening flashed in the distance as Dragon Riders, armored for battle, came flying towards them. ""What should we do?' Magnus asked Gem. ""We meet them head on!' Gem said in her mind. Then,with a loud battle screech, she drew her sword, and charged ahead. ""That""s our princess,"" Gerrek said, ""Just like her dad,"" he hefted his axe. ""Yes, let""s go,"" Greebus said, ""And may Myre be with us."" They drew their weapons again, and charged. Transition ""Look at those fools!"" Prince Orson cried. ""Charging form the ground! This Lord Magnus really is crazy!"" ""Who""s that girl in front?"" Shiris asked Leaf. ""That""s Princess Gemini of Flaim, daughter of King Spark and Queen Neese."" Leaf said. ""Spark""s daughter and Parn""s son?"" Shiris asked. ""What have we gotten ourselves into? Let""s descend!"" she ordered, ""We don""t want to fight them."" Shiris lead the dragon riders to the ground, and she leaped off her dragon as the Gem and their party raced over the dunes. ""Halt!"" Shiris cried, ""We don""t want to fight!"" ""Shiris?"" Ryna asked as they halted their attack. ""What are you doing here?"" ""It""s that guy who took Leaf!"" Maar yelled, pointing at Orson. ""That""s my thick headed son,"" Shiris said. ""He knows better."" ""Hey!"" Orson yelled in protest. ""We demand that you return Leaf,"" Magnus cried, ""Now."" ""Don""t worry, I""m right here!"" Leaf said, climbing from the dragon""s back. She skipped over to Magnus, and asked, ""Did you miss me?"" ""I uh..."" Magnus said, stepping behind Gem. ""You can""t be Parn""s son,"" Shiris said suddenly. She stepped over to Magnus, and took his face in her hands, turning it this way and that, ""There""s no way! You look more like Deedlit."" ""Yes, Deedlit is my mother,"" Magnus said. ""Well you""d think you""d get your looks from Parn. Now there was a handsome man. Brave and chivalrous and kind!"" ""And what was my dad? Chop liver?"" Orson asked angrily. ""Your father couldn""t ever hold a candle to Parn. Or your namesake."" Shiris said quietly. Magnus looked in the face of this fiery queen, and saw her hidden heart ache there. ""Um... Well, thank you for returning Leaf,"" Magnus said.",512464
2282,"Reunion Teaser: Part 2 of the two-part reunion episode. Brenda""s back but her reunion isn""t going to be a cheery one.... With a jealous and conniving Gina, a hurt Kelly and Steve, a yearning Noah, and two surprise visitors in the background will Dylan and Brenda ever find happiness? Will they even get to talking? --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The rain pattered against the window pane hard as the rainstorm continued, the rain had gotten so hard that it made a shatter when it hit the windows but the only thing that Dylan McKay could pay attention to was the beautiful woman standing on his front porch holding three bags of luggage. He stared at her face and noticed that she was soaking wet, her hair was drenched and the water had smeared her makeup but he hadn""t noticed, he noticed her but not the smeared makeup. Gina stood slightly behind Dylan surveying every inch of Brenda, she had never been jealous of anyone before because she had no need to but she truly loved Dylan and the girl, the soaked burnette, was the one he loved and not her. ""Bren? Is that you?"" Dylan could hardly believe that she was there. She had to be a dream. Brenda nodded. She tried saying something but her throat got sore and she choked on her words, it had been so long since she talked to him she forgot how to. ""Hey Dylan, I""m home"" The words had finally found their way out of her mouth. Dylan pulled her in for a hug and to his surprise she didn""t pull back, not like the last time they hugged, she had pulled away before but this time she held on. He smelled her hair, the aroma of strawberries filled his nose. She smelled so nice but everything about her was nice, he couldn""t get enough of her. Brenda held on to Dylan holding back tears, he had no idea how hard coming back was and to come to him of all people was harder then anything she had done before. She had tried to get over him, to move on with her life but she couldn""t, she wouldn""t let go and she resented herself for that. They finally pulled apart. ""It""s so nice to see you, what are you doing here?"" ""I was in town"" Brenda swayed back and forth still holding on to her bags. ""Wow how nice of you to drop in"" Gina replied. Both Dylan and Brenda looked back at her, Brenda stared at her. ""Um sorry but do I know you?"" Gina looked at Brenda. ""Oh no, we""ve never had the pleasure. I""m a friend of Kelly and Donna""s"" Brenda winced when she heard the name Kelly but immediately lit up with a huge smile on her face when she heard the name Donna, it had been so long since she heard that name, she missed her so much. She missed Kelly the least. Gina stared at Brenda who had a huge smile on her face. ""What?"" ""Oh it""s nothing, you said Donna and it brought back some old memories. Me and Donna knew each other from High School, we were best friends, the closest two people could ever be.",29783
411,"William stood before him, head tilted to the side, patiently waiting for Ulrich""s instructions. He stared at Ulrich with void, empty eyes. Ulrich""s submissive had been reduced to a lifeless automaton, without free will or self-awareness. This was William at his most beautiful. And (according to Jeremie) this ""soullessly receptive"" state was an after affect of being under X.A.N.A. ""s hold for so long. Apparently, it had something to do with William""s submissive personality. Jeremie had droned on and on about how because X.A.N.A. was able to manifest in the real world, it wasn""t out of the question that William would be able to reenter that state if the right person came along. ""But not just any person,"" Jeremie had said. ""Only those that have been to Lyoko would be able to tap into this unique ability."" Jeremie hadn""t inquired further and promised to keep William""s ""condition"" a secret from the others. The point was, Ulrich was able to take control of William""s body the same way X.A.N.A. could. Ulrich pulled William in for a kiss, soft at first, but quickly turning hot and heavy, leaving William flushed and unbearably hard. In the front of William""s pants emerged a growing wet spot. Unlike X.A.N.A., Ulrich preferred to keep William""s personality just below the surface (for easy access). Ulrich wanted his automaton""s reaction to at least respond like the real William (because Ulrich didn""t want to have to do all the work). Ulrich reached inside William""s head; he had to admit, it was addicting-fun, controlling someone without giving them verbal commands. He watched silently as William fell to his knees. ""Ulrich,"" William whispered softly. Then again, there were times when William""s subconscious managed to float to the surface. Within the confines of Ulrich""s demands, of course. ""Please,"" his submissive added. Ulrich wasn""t sure what William had been asking for, but it didn""t matter, because William would be subjected to Ulrich""s whims. And he had plans, because he had a few hours before Yumi was set to meet up with them and Ulrich wanted to play. Not just for fun, but because Ulrich had a purpose; as he mentioned earlier, Ulrich was a bastard but Yumi needed to understand first hand. Because Ulrich cared too much for their friendship to hide the truth. He had never allowed anyone to see William the submissive (Ulrich had a possessive streak a mile wide). But...Yumi would never understand if she didn""t see for herself. Sure, Ulrich had told Jeremie a little about his interactions with William, and his friend had a vague notion of what his relationship with William was, but Jeremie hadn""t asked too many questions. The man was content with knowing that Ulrich and William were together, never mind how. Ulrich walked to his military green, high-grade duffle bag shuffling through the contents until he found a pair of scissors and three bundles of rope. Ulrich eyed William""s shirt. It was one of his submissive""s favorites, having dressed up for their mysterious meeting in the woods.",583994
2015,"Said""s thoughts and questions were cut short as Beecher""s soothing voice started speaking. ""Oh yeah you were in the hole, well he""s been here for a few days. The judge decided that he should spend his remaining sentence in OZ before he spends another one."" Said smiled, he could see the happiness painted all over Beecher""s face, Beecher was happy and if Beecher was happy... then damn it he was happy. ""I""m happy for you"" Beecher tilted his head. ""What happened to homosexual acts being wrong to Allah, that it was a discrimination"" Said took a second to think about this, yes it was true, that to Allah homosexual acts were a discrimination... indeed it was true, but there was just something about the way Beecher looked at Keller that made him re-think things --- typical of Beecher to do this to him. ""Fuck Allah---"" Said stopped briefly when he saw the look on Beecher""s face. ""I have tried my best to be the man I was before you walked into my life Tobias, but I""m not that naive man anymore. Allah doesn""t save people, Allah didn""t save your children, Allah didn""t save the people who needed to be saved. I have seen you grow up, I saw you the first day you walked into OZ and you were merely a lost soul, you didn""t know what way to go and you were trapped, Shillenger had trapped you and exploited you, humiliated you, and I had wanted so badly to reach out to you, show you that there was another way but I knew that this was a lesson you had to learn on your own---"" ""Some lesson I learned..."" Said smiled sweetly before going on. ""He had made you into a victim Beecher, but you escaped him and became a victimizer, you broke free of the hold Shillenger had on you and you hit him back with all you had, taking the dignity that was yours to begin with, all yours Beecher. You have changed so much from the person that walked in here, you are a brave soul Tobias Beecher and I am glad to say you are my friend and if you love Christopher Keller---- so be it."" Beecher and Said stared at each other, once again, taking in the silence and then Beecher wrapped his arm around Said""s neck pulling him in for a hug, the hug lasted a bit longer then it should have. Keller glared at the scene, Keller knew he wasn""t the only prisoner in the hospital that was watching what was going on between Beecher and Said, he knew that the other prisoners in the hospital were staring at ""them"" and that made him even more upset. Watching Said and Beecher, had made him jealous before too, but his jealousy vibes were going crazy--- maybe it was because Said had come to Beecher""s rescue that day in the library ---- because he did something that Keller couldn""t do himself, but the jealousy was definitely there. ""Oooh K-boy, I think you""re getting green"" Keller snapped his icy blue eyes away from Said and Beecher and examined the injured body of Ryan O""Reily, who was pulling his white wifebeater over his head with care.",29783
727,"The awkward air of silence conquered them. Sofia gently dusted off her purple dress studded with purple sequins while James ran a hand through his blond hair. He took a glance at Sofia but he quickly looked away because he realized how beautiful she was with her curly, long brown hair that was now at waist level. Plus, her purple gown made her look even more gorgeous. ""So Amber is finally getting married."" Sofia said, breaking the awkward tension between them. James perked up, as he gave her a quick reply. ""Yeah! It""s so sudden. I mean, it""s as if yesterday you just move here."" He said with a small smile, making Sofia smile too. ""I am really happy that mom married your dad."" Sofia suddenly said. James was about to say something, but he was a bit startled with his step-sister""s words. ""Ever since we moved here, everyday became an adventure and I learned a lot of important things. And..."" She continued as he walked a little bit closer to James. On the other hand, he simply stood still and waited for Sofia to finish. ""... I met you."" She said, almost a whisper. James felt his face burn up upon hearing those words. ""Sofia..."" ""U-uh... I mean... it""s really great having you as a big brother."" She continued with her hands fidgeting. James felt a struck of frustration hitting him all over again. He mentally sighed, and then gave Sofia a forced smile. ""I am glad you became my sister too."" He replied. Deep inside, he realized that his vision of love just shattered in front of his eyes. Sofia walked back to the palace, leaving James by himself in the garden. He said he wanted to stay there for a while to inhale more fresh air. She sighed to herself as she continued on walking, mentally scolding herself for almost showing how she really feels for James. ""He probably thinks I am weird."" She muttered to herself. ""Why did I have to sputter such nonsense in front of James? After all, he already loves someone else..."" As she walked towards the banquet hall, she felt a hand touch her shoulder, dragging her back out of the hall. She was caught in surprise as she let out a small gasp. She turned around to see who that was who dragged her out and was relieved to see Amber holding her fan elegantly. ""Where were you?"" Amber asked sternly, making Sofia flinch a bit. ""Outside..."" ""Well! I was looking all over for you! There""s someone I would like you to meet."" She said as he tightly held Sofia""s wrist and led her towards the banquet hall through the crowd. Different people were a bit surprised to see the two princesses walking through the party as Amber walked swiftly with her heels clicking. Sofia could only muster a small apology. ""Amber... you know I don""t want to be set up with another man. There""s someone I already love and you know who it is!"" She whispered to her blond sister. ""Yeah, yeah I know. You love James so much, blah blah blah."" Amber replied, completely ignoring Sofia""s restrains. As they reached the farthest pillar inside the hall, there stood Amber""s fiancé and another man talking to each other.",2750536
2338,"""Megumi Fujiwara!"" ""I""m here!"" And after the androgynous roll call, the class settled into a state of suspended animation, as Ms. Hanaya""s lecture turned into an instant black hole, sucking all the life that was once abundant in the classroom. The hour passed by with nothing but ""No! No! Am goes with I as Are goes with We!"" and ""A is the first letter of the alphabet! Not P!"" Haru and the others came out an hour later, everyone clutching their stomachs. Elie looked a bit green and Julius, with the blue haired boy, a bit azure. ""I don""t believe this...am I cursed to go through her for the full year?!?!"" Haru groaned, feeling nauseous and about to throw up. ""Don""t worry, Haru...we all went through it..."" Elie assured him, then ran to the side and hid herself behind the grove of Chinese bamboos. Haru could hear sickening groans of throwing up. ""Ugh."" Elie wiped her mouth, as Haru stood by, watching her drink from the fountain. ""I am never gonna drink three cans of soda without eating breakfast. It tastes horrible!"" She made a face, recounting the taste of bile at the back of her throat. ""Hey, Haru-kun. Wanna eat at the cafeteria? I""m starving, and it""s lunch time anyway."" Julius came up to both of them, eyeing Elie with mild irritation as so did the girl at Julius. ""Uhm. Julius-kun. This is Elie."" Haru introduced the girl, as Elie stuck her tongue out at him. Julius pulled his eyelid down at her as well, mocking her. Haru laughed nervously, pushing the two away as each started to assault the other with obscene and more perverse hand gestures. ""I assume you two know each other..."" ""Sigh, both of them had been childhood rivals ever since they entered school. And it was not a bit that both of them are still fighting at least over something now, which would be you, Haru-san."" Haru jumped a little as a cold voice brushed at his back. ""It""s Seighart."" The blue haired boy that accompanied Julius introduced himself, to which Haru acknowledged. ""German, I assume?"" Haru smiled back, to which Seighart favored a wry grin. ""Mm. Ever the keen one are we? How did you know?"" Seighart looked at the platinum blonde, amused by him. ""I figured that out when I heard your name. It pays when you play RPG""s"" Haru grinned. ""Kimi wa omosiroi desu yo?"" Seighart shook his head, still smiling. ""Arigatou. Now to do something about them?"" Haru pointed at the two, almost at the point of tearing each other""s eye out. ""Kansha shitemasu. I was almost gonna forget about them. Oi, Julius-kun..."" Seighart made a beeline at the boy, as Haru did with Elie. Both were flushed at their bout with each other. ""Elie-san. Try to forget anything with Julius. He""s my friend too. It also hurts me if both of you don""t agree with each other..."" Haru gave a weak smile at Elie, who was still pouting. ""Hmph. That kiiro saru! I have every mind to throttle the bastard into oblivion..."" Elie got cut short as Haru turned away, with a hurt expression. Elie sought to take what she said back. ""I...It""s okay. Who am I anyway to go against between you?",583064
964,"He kept glancing at me, and smiling in such a way that my blood ran cold in my veins. When I finished playing, I tried to return to my room, but Odelle stopped me, and pulled me aside. She informed me, her overly painted smile venomous, that Father""s old associate, Sharp, wanted me as his mistress. The very thought of that disgusting man, touching me and looking at me that way, made me want to retch. I refused to go, but Odelle laughed and said I had no choice. I was still two years from being old enough to called an adult, she was still my guardian, and she had already given Sharp her consent. I would be taken the next morning to be his personal whore, she said. She told me I was exactly like my mother... and with any luck I would end up like her, too. That final insult is what drove me to action. After she, and all the servants, were asleep, I gathered up one change of clothes and my violin, then I escaped the attic, and ran away. You must be thinking, ""If it was soeasy, why didn""t you do it before?'. I didn""t do it because, as I said, I was still living in my home- Father""s home. I couldn""t abandon it. But when Odelle made her deal with Sharp, I knew I would never have my home. My only options were to go with him and become his harlotte, kill myself, or run. The first choice was worse than death, and the second would only give Odelle what she wanted more than anything. That is why I finally chose to escape. After that, ther isn""t much. I taveled to Paris, and played my violin on the street, using what little money I had or made to rent the room where... Where Eric discovered me. That, gentlemen, is my story. End Narration Pierre looked at her like a child whose""s just had the most fantastic and magic filled bedtime story told to them. Erik, however, looked at is young pupil without any expression. Infact his gaze was a little too intense for her. She got up and covered her mouth, giving a fake yawn. ""Oh, excuse me, gentlemen,"" she said. ""I think I""ll retire. Goodnight."" and she went to her rooms. After her door closed, Pierre leaped up on his feet, and said, ""I think I""ll go home and rest, too. Good night, Master Erik."" As Pierre reached the main door, his hand just about to grasp the handle, Erik called, ""Boy."" Pierrer paused. He asked over his shoulder, ""Yes, Sir?"" ""Do you believe her story?"" the older man asked. Pierre thought a moment. Then he said, ""Why shouldn""t I? It""s Celeste""s."" Then he also left. Transition Celeste brushed her hair absentmindedly as she sat on the edge of her bed. But soon she grew tired of it, and set her brush down, then opened the drawer of her bedside table, pulling out the miniature painting. She looked at the face that resembled her own. Then put her fingertip on the signature on the bottom. ""Wishing he were somehow here again, Wishing he were somehow near...?"" Celeste jumped and held her treasure to her chest as she looked up at Erik. He just seemed to appear to like magic, leaning on the wall, half his face in shadow. ""You know this is indecent?"" she snapped.",512464
3704,"She picked out a ring with a pretty pink stone."" Hunt took another sip and took a deep breath before continuing. ""I thought it was a sapphire, an expensive one, but I thought it was a sapphire. Until she started talking about our engagement in the car, if I""d known she was looking at pink diamonds I would""ve steered her away."" Sloan was confused. ""Don""t they label them? Didn""t you see the label?"" ""I was looking at her, not the jewelry. I only wanted out of the doghouse! I didn""t want to marry her, but you can""t really take that back. I was driving home trying to think of a way out if it, and there just isn""t one. I swear, I was the only guy in Iraq who was hoping his girl would cheat on him, so I""d have an easy out. I always knew I wasn""t going to marry her, but couldn""t figure out how to make-up for that pain. Only to realize there is no way."" ""I slept with my best friend""s wife."" Hunt looked to Sloan, the beer slowing his brain and needed an extra minute to remember the beginning of the night. When he finally nodded in understanding, Sloan continued, ""The man who was closer than a brother to me and I slept with his wife, even fell in love with her. There is no forgiving that. Not really. I mean we""re good now because he has Meredith, but the trust, it""ll never be like it used to."" Hunt waited for him to continue, and Sloan took another drink. ""I was always the screw-up, where he was always perfect. Even when he had problems and acted like a complete ass, he was perfect and I was the screw-up. Though I have my theories, I can only guess as to why he punched me, but I know why I punched him back."" Both men took a drink, enjoying the filling beer slide down their throats as they sat together in silence lost in their memories. The bar had filled since they first came in, and the noise covered any lapses in conversation. Mark was the one to break it. ""I could really go for some chicken wings right now, Buffalo style."" Owen looked up. ""Me too."" He checked the time at the bar. ""Doubt the kitchen""s still open here though."" ""Damn."" Mark finished his drink and brought back down on the table, hard. Owen finished his drink as well, but lowered his glass with much less force. He started to put on his coat. ""Come on, I know a place that has the best wings in Seattle, and it""s open late."" Mark started to put on his own jacket as Owen called a cab. They began to make their way to the door, in a not quite straight line. Mark pointed a finger at Owen, wanting to make something clear, ""I""m from New York, it""s going to take a lot to impress me."" Owen saw Mark stagger and put his hand on his arm to steady the other man, much like he did after the fight. ""Oh, you might be surprised with Seattle."" A/N: I wrote nothing that is italized. Vows Preston Burke looked over his vows for the woman he was about to marry for the hundredth time. He changed a sentence and read them again. He felt like starting over once more. Christina, I could promise to hold you and to cherish you. He""d written his vows for Cristina in one shot.",1497577
912,"Kikyo had passed her fifteenth winter, and was now known as a great beauty in the village, and young Keade was quickly learning her responsibilities as a miko. And both girls now looked at Sonoa as a surrogate mother. On one particular day, in early spring when the frosts of winter still clung to land in a desperate grasp, a strange man on a horse came riding up to the Shrine. He wore green armor, and black clothing that clung to his body, like a Ninja. He carried a large kunai with him. He walked through the courtyard, and to the back gardens, where Sonoa was practicing archery with Kikyo and Keade. As the priestess looked up, she smiled at the man in black, and ran to him, embracing him. The spoke a few words that Kikyo and Keade did not hear, then Sonoa went back to Kikyo and said, ""Kikyo, This is my elder brother, Shako. I must speak with him briefly. Will you please give Keade her archery lesson?"" ""Yes, Mistress, but why-"" ""It is not your place to question,"" Sonoa said rather harshly. Kikyo was taken aback. Her mentor never spoke like this to her. But then the older woman""s face softened. ""Forgive me,"" Sonoa said, ""But please, Kikyo, give me a moment with my brother."" ""Yes, ma""am."" Kikyo said. The brother and sister left them, and while Kikyo showed her sster the best way to hold the arrow to get distance, she thought about the urgency that was in her teacher""s face. When they were inside, in her private rooms, Sonoa poured some tea for her brother. He sipped the hot tea, and sat there, solemnity on his young face. He was still young indeed. He was just two years her senior, and yet he was already married, to her old best friend from their village, far away. Sonoa had never told her young pupils much of her past. Sonoa had been born the youngest daughter of the leader of a band of demon slayers. She had already been learning archery with her father when her powers were discovered. She was then taken by the monks and priests of this shrine, to learn to hone her abilities. She had been appointed head priestess at 15 winters, the age Kikyo was now. But, every year, Sonoa still returned to her old village for an important purpose. For when she had discovered her holy powers, she also discovered that she, and she alone, could purify the sacred jewel that her father""s house kept hidden. She could purify the evil from the Shikon no Tama: the Jewel of Four Souls. But she was still not strong enough to keep pure all the time. Whenever even the slightest hint of corruption touched the jewel, it became tainted. And more and more you-kai came to steal the jewel. This was the matter her brother brought to her now. ""Sister,"" Shako said, ""We have lost too many. The Jewel needs someone to protect it, and keep it pure on a regular basis. Please, sister, return to the village."" ""I cannot,"" she said, ""I have my pupils; my duties here."" ""Then take the jewel and keep it here!"" he begged, ""I will not have more of our comrades die because of this accursed Jewel!"" ""And I will not bring these girls or this village to danger!""",512464
2775,"Dr. Gosunkugi aka Scarecrow was the first to deal with Gotham Ward""s new defender of the night, but what next challenge will our hero face next? Ranma Saotome and Kasumi Tendo, and with the help of the Jusenkyo Guide, have finally finished designing and building...""The Girlcave""! A inner sanctum for Ranma, made for storing his arsenal, used to plan his next move to prevent crime in Gotham Ward, a place to train for upcoming battles, and it is set up to resemble a small shopping mall since girls are known for hanging out in malls. Like in a mall, all of Ranma/Girlman""s utilities are stored in many sections of this place. The sports store is where the weapons and arsenal are stored and tested, the food court is where Kasumi makes her cuisine, a perfume shop where chemicals are tested and examined, the department store is where the girl-suit and spare girl-suits are stored, a museum for trophies from Ranma""s adventures are stored such as Scarecrow""s mask, a auto shop where the Girlmobile is stored and repaired, a Tendo Dojo where Ranma trains (Soun apparently started a franchise), and a internet cafe coffee shop is where Ranma""s computer equiptment is stored at and where he spends his time the most, watching over the city for when evil rears it""s ugly head. With each new addition, the girlcave will become bigger than last time and will resemble more of a mall. Ranma then thanks the guide for his help and Kasumi then says, ""Mr. Jusenkyo Guide, with a voice like that, you can narrarate documentaries about cute penguins."" The guide blushes and goes back to china with one of Ranma""s heli-copters. But then, Ranma is now going through a serious problem he just remembered, the next charity event is taking place at a pool party. And as he remembers, if he gets splashed by cold water, he will turn into his cursed girl form (aka Girlman) and his identity will be exposed, yet he has a reputation for NEVER missing a charity fundraiser and this fundraiser is for getting ""Weird Al"" Yankovic a star in Hollywood...that and for the MDA. And so as he tries to find a way to get out of this one, his computer in the Girlcave picks up a report about a demented circus troupe terrorizing the pool party and trying to make off with the charity money. Ranma then sees the ""Girl-signal"" beamed into the sky and then pours cold water on him/herself puts on a black suit, she then wears a mask that exposes her pigtail. And then she puts on a utility belt. Ranma then says, ""Take note of this Kasumi but I will only say this once...I""m glad criminal activity just protected my idenity...I""ll repay those crooks with a one way trip to Arkham!"" Girlman then jumps to the Girlmobile and drives to the pool party. Girlman then sees what appears to be clowns in Skull masks in motorcycles, terrorizing those in the pool area and then Clowns in scuba gear attack those in the pool. Girlman then has the Lifeguards tell everyone to run out of the rool while Girlman takes care of the ""pool scum"".",910821
2932,"She said then went on with her walking. I nodded and went on as well. After seeing her so distressed at the stairs, I felt really bad and... weird? Well I don""t know... All I know is that, I am dragging myself to my classroom. This day couldn""t get any worse. Classes are over and it""s time for the club meeting. I went up to our room, practically dragging myself. I guess it""s still early because no one is inside. I went in, placed my bag on the table, sat down on a chair, and continued reading a book. I guess I was really engrossed in the book, because the next thing I knew was Satoshi and Ibara""s entrance. ""Look""s like someone""s eager for a club meeting!"" Satoshi said, obviously referring to me. ""Shut up."" I said in reply. He chuckled then sat down. I never looked up though. I think Ibara did the same thing too. ""How was the History Test, Fuku-chan?"" ""It went okay. I think I aced it thanks to your help!"" The two carried on their conversation. I just read on. Maybe a few minutes went by, the sliding door opened and revealed Chitanda, trying to catch her breath. ""I-I am so sorry I am late, everyone!"" she politely said as she bowed down. ""No worries, Chi-chan!"" Ibara said in an apologetic way. And yet when I am late, she goes all mad at me. I just made a simple stare at them, and then returned to my book. And I think I saw Chitanda sneak a glance at me. What is she thinking right at the moment? Ibara and Chitanda had to go early because of something I never really heard what. Satoshi stayed, and so did I. I was about to finish my book when Satoshi turned to me. ""Yo."" ""Hm?"" ""Chitanda-san doesn""t look so well today."" I glanced at Satoshi to see his face. I think he""s serious. ""How can you say so?"" I asked. ""Well first, she can""t even look up at us."" I produced a shocked ""huh?' What did Satoshi mean? ""What?"" ""I mean, she just kept on looking down, with an awkward smile on her face."" I gulped and tried to imagine Chitanda""s awkward smile. Okay, that sounded wrong so I""ll stop thinking about her now. ""And I think that this has something to do with yesterday."" Satoshi said. I felt my sweat roll down my cheek. My hands were getting colder by the moment. Satoshi is trying to corner me! ""Tell me, Houtarou... what-"" ""Nothing."" I answered hurriedly. I answered him hurriedly as if I know his question. Damn, I am letting myself be trapped in his snare... ""Nothing what, Hou-ta-rou?"" He asked, getting more persistent. I transferred my gaze opposite from him, obviously looking dumb. ""I-I don""t know."" I answered. Satoshi raised an eyebrow with a scheming smile. That scheming smile. ""Something did happen right?"" ""..."" ""Come on! Don""t let me make Mayaka make you talk, Ho-"" ""I-I k-kissed Chitanda!"" I answered without thinking. Satoshi""s eyes widened in shock. From shock, his lips formed a sheepish grin. ""I knew it."" ""N-no, no... I didn""t kiss her, she-"" ""Kissed you?"" ""Yeah. No! I mean, she did initiate the kiss-"" ""So Chitanda-san really did kiss you!"" ""NO. I kissed her."" ""What?"" ""Damn it Satoshi, I kissed her, but she told me to!"" I finally said.",2750536

490,"She asked Hotch and Rossi, the former just shaking his head while the latter looked up at her rather lazily, ""Not yet. We""re waiting on word from Morgan and Emily."" ""Well, it seems that the unsub only let""s out his aggression postmortem rather then when the victim is alive,"" I said quietly, sitting down next to Rossi, ""The victim dies from a lethal dose of the Barbituate derivative Methohexital, suggesting that the unsub either has access to it or is getting the drug off the black market."" ""There""s the good doctor,"" Rossi said quietly. Hotchner nodded; he flipped out his phone and dialed quickly, ""Garcia? I need you to look up St. Mary""s records. Anything that has to do with Methohexital, specifically who it""s been prescribed to, what doctors have prescribed it, if any stock has gone missing, et cetera. Go back the last thirteen years, if you can..."" She must have said something to him, but Hotch looked over at me quickly, ""Yes, he is, why?"" A sigh escaped him and Hotch shook his head, ""Alright, but make it short, okay? I am expecting Morgan or Emily to call soon."" My eyebrows shot up as he handed the phone across the table to me. Looking at him incredulously, I saw him mouth ""She wants to talk to you"" and sighed. I picked up the phone and said a rather apprehensive ""Hello?"" Then it began, ""Reid, I am so sorry! I saw you go storming out of the room, then heard this bang and... and... oh, I am so sorry! I called Derek and all he told me was J.J. was taking you to the hospital! Are you okay? Please, please tell me you""re okay. I would feel so bad if you broke yourself or the precinct because of what I said! Oooh it was so stupid of me to tell you! I should have... I dunno, done something different! Spence, honey, I am so-"" ""It""s okay, I""m alright Garcia,"" I sighed again, shaking my head with the ghost of a grin present on my face. Penelope Garcia, the ""Mother Hen"" of the BAU, ""Just hit a wall."" My attempt to calm her was a waste after my last few words, ""Hit a wall?! Oh my god, Reid, is your hand okay? I didn""t know you would react so strongly... you""re usually so cool and awkward... I am so sorry! Is anything broken, honey? Please, please tell me you""re-"" ""I thought I already said I was okay, Garcia,"" I sighed, ""There""s no break; Hotch just wanted to make sure, so he had J.J. drive me to the hospital."" Before Garcia could sling another plethora of apologies, I handed the phone back to Hotchner and gave another sigh. Rossi, on the other hand, looked amused. Before he could comment, I tactfully decided to leave with the excuse of checking up on Morgan and Prentiss. However, I soon found out that I didn""t have too; seconds after leaving the room I turned the corner and found myself suddenly on the ground. A slight hiss escaped me as I landed - rather awkwardly - on my bruised hand. ""Oh damn, Reid. Twice in one day?"" I looked up to see Morgan standing above me, his arm outstretched. I took it slowly and he pulled me up a little too quickly; I stumbled right into him.",748687
449,"When he heard his name he froze, but he didn""t turn around. ""I""m sorry Matt, I shouldn""t have yelled at you,"" I replied crossing my arms after I had just finished drying my hands. Matt turned to look at me and I could tell he had been crying, and from whatever it was it wasn""t because of our fight. ""It""s okay; I shouldn""t have been looking at your stuff. I was just... I want to know what""s going on Shay. You seem...distant,"" he replied crossing his arms and leaning against the wall. ""Where are you going,"" I asked staring at the keys in his hand. ""I""m going to visit the reverend,"" he replied looking down at them. ""May I come,"" I asked hopeful. He stood there a moment just watching me as if I was an ant under his microscope. Finally, after a few moments, he nodded. I sat the dishrag down and walked with him toward the door. As we walked outside we told Wendy where we were going and said we""d be back later that evening. I let her know I had my cell phone on me and to call if she needed anything, and then we were off as we drove down the road towards the church. When we arrived Popescu was waiting for us outside. I smiled knowing he had finally gotten out of the hospital. As I stepped out of the car he smiled and walked up to me giving me a hug. ""How are you doing,"" he asked pulling away as Matt walked around the car over to us. ""I""m good, what about you. I see they let you out of the hospital early,"" I smiled as Matt wrapped his arm around me catching the eye of Popescu who smiled at the affectionate display from Matt. ""Yes, well, I had to literally beg them too. That place was driving me up the wall,"" he laughed waving us to follow him over to the steps of the church. I cringed as I noticed that around the church was a graveyard. As if I wasn""t around enough death. We all took a seat on the steps. I took mine a step below Matt so that I was sitting between his legs. Matt didn""t mind infect he pulled me closer to him. Popescu began talking as I ignored him and looked around at all the old tombstones. Some of them had to be as old as the civil wars days. Some were weathered down and others were broken apart. One caught my eye though. It was an angel with her hands together praying. I smiled, as I eventually turned my attention back to the conversation at hand. ""It""s all around us, all the time, the living and the dead...invisible to everyone. Almost everyone,"" Popescu spoke looking over at Matt. Matt scratched his head, a nervous habit, replying, ""Yeah."" ""Because we""re not like other people anymore. You see most people spend their life firmly planted in this world and one day they go straight to the other side, but we...we take a much more round about path. We... spend quite a lot of time in the border land, but either way, only one thing matters,"" the Reverend spoke as he looked between me and Matt. ""Yeah what""s that,"" Matt asked reaching up to scratch his head again, nervously might I add. ""Well, find out what he what he wants from you,"" Popescu answered looking over at Matt and then down at me. ""I know what he wants from me.",806976
1407,"Have you found her?"" Aya greeted a very exhausted Yuuhi. He was a total wreck. ""No,"" he answered. ""I""ll go and find her again after I check Shota.,"" he walked towards Shota""s room when... ""Ouch!...Ah!"" Yuuhi spun around to see Aya clutching her belly. ""Aya! What""s wrong? Help!"" Yuuhi ran towards Aya and supported her. Suzumi, Q-chan and Aki arrived. Toya still hasn""t come back from finding Chidori. ""I...I...think I""ll...Ouch!"" Aya shouted in pain. ""Q-chan! The car! Aki! Call Toya! Quick!"" Suzumi instructed as she help Yuuhi support Aya. ""Aya, you""ll be alright. Don""t worry,"" Suzumi whispered as they went inside the car.------------------------------- ""Good thing it wasn""t that serious,"" Chichiri noted as Nuriko told them Tasuki""s condition. They were in the waiting area of the hospital ""He never learns. How many times did we tell him not to go leaping from tree to tree. He is not a monkey!"" Mitsukake said. ""He does think and act sometimes like a monkey,"" Nuriko commented thoughtfully. The others nodded.------------------------------- ""Aya, hold on. Toya will be here,"" Yuuhi said as he watched Aya being wheeled to the Emergency room. Only Suzumi went inside with Aya. ""Where is Aya?!"" Toya came running towards Yuuhi and Aki. ""She""s inside,"" Aki pointed the emergency room. ""Aya, please be alright. Aya, please be alright..."" Toya kept on mumbling as he paced back and forth. ""Aya will be aright. You will also have your daughter soon,"" Aki assured Toya. He patted his shoulder. ""I think I want to get something to drink,"" Yuuhi walked away. He tried to find a vending machine but with no success. He approached a nurse and asked her, ""Excuse me, where could I find a vending machine?"" ""You could find some in the waiting area. Just go straight ahead,"" the nurse answered. ""Thanks,"" Yuuhi said as he followed the direction the nurse gave him.------------------------- ""I""ll just buy something to drink,"" Chidori said as she went to the nearest vending machine. She hummed along the way.------------------------ ""There it is!"" Yuuhi walked towards a vending machine. After getting his drink, he heard someone humming a very familiar tune. He turned his head to look at the vending machine to his right. He dropped the can he was holding. ""Chi...Chi...Chidori....?"" He whispered. The pink haired girl turned to him and gasped.

2099,"Saitama said before Tatsumaki could close her apartment""s door. Slightly taken aback, the small esper glared up at the bald hero. ""Excuse me? Are you trying to imply that you and I are friends?"" she asked, somewhat tempted to use her powers on him. Again, Saitama regretted opening his mouth. ""I was just trying to tell you that not all people are bad-"" ""Shut up! SHUT UP! There is no way in hell I would create relations with people! Relationship creates trust, and in trust people would just blindingly assume that there would be someone to depend on, that someone would come and save them when they really need it and Blast-"" Tatsumaki paused, not really realizing that tears were already flowing down her cheeks. ""Blast taught me to never expect someone to come save me again, no matter what the situation is. The world is full of evil, and I only have myself to trust."" she muttered finally. For once, Saitama actually listened to her. What she went through when she was a kid was most probably the reason why she was like this; the reason for her arrogance and for pushing people away and being overly protective to Fubuki. With a slight smile, he patted her head comfortingly, which only shocked Tatsumaki. ""I can""t say for sure that I understand how you feel but I assure you that there are still people righteous enough to be called a hero; to be trusted."" Saitama said. Tatsumaki glanced up at him, still slightly confused. ""I won""t press you to tell me everything. I""ll just wait until you tell me yourself."" He said with a small smile as he gently brushed of her tears with the back of his hand. With a slight nod, he walked away and muttered a small ""see you tomorrow"", leaving a dumbfounded Tatsumaki alone in her apartment""s doorway. Aaaaaaaanaaaaaaaand we""re back with the angst. And the OOC-ness. Pfft. See ya""ll laturs. BACK! My brain finally conjured of something to get the plot going! Anyway, I hope this one""s a good chapter mehe~ I really tried to keep everyone in character. But hey, this is ONE""s work we""re talking about. The characters are complex amirite? Tatsumaki could somehow still feel the warmth of Saitama""s hand when he patted her head to comfort her. It wasn""t that big of a deal for a gesture, but it sure struck her. Oddly enough, it actually felt nice. When was the last time someone pat her head? Probably when she was still a kid, her foster parents would pat her head occasionally, and that was before she was taken away from them. After escaping the damned laboratory, her parents were a bit distant from her. And so, she already forgot what it felt like to be comforted by someone. She was aware that her face was getting warmer, but she was also sure that she wasn""t blushing. Hell, why would she get flustered about a stupid pat? From an A-class hero, no less. She suddenly realized she was mindlessly switching channels on her television with her remote, not even focusing on the T.V. ""What the hell am I thinking?"" Tatsumaki muttered as she stood up, scratching her head in annoyance.",2750536

Khan, the most evil man in all of anime. So if the demon has a name, the name is ""That jerk who ruined ""One Piece"" and ""Shaman King""!"" ""Due to my strong personal convictions, I wish to stress that this fanfic in no way endorses Satanism."" -Neowinterknight- (yes, this is a parody of the disclaimer from ""Michael Jackson""s Thriller"") I hope no one notices I reused Hell jokes from my past fanfics but I really want Eddy""s hell to be so scary and surreal, it will make ""SUPERJAIL"" look like Kindergarden... ENJOY! Last Time: In the days that took place before the Eds met Grim, Eddy does the unthinkable and he makes a deal with a demon who strangly resembles Alfred E. Khan, chairman of 4KIDS (he""s just plain evil... ok?) so Eddy ends up with the midas touch, a power that turns anything the user touches into gold but Eddy got too much he can handle when his clothes turn to gold, his food, drink, and jawbreakers turn to gold...and kids into gold. He accidentally turned Nazz into gold (except for Sarah, Plank, and the Kankers... they deserved that!) but when Eddy""s run ran out, the demon came back to claim his soul and those he turned into gold.",910821

1896,"""So nice of you to make it through my Seven Courses of Chaos, Ladybug, Chat Noir. Let me reward you with dessert!"" Calamity spat, as she touched her neck- no, she touched a necklace. ""My lady, it seems our akuma has impeccable taste in jewelry. It""s in her necklace."" Ladybug looked over at him and then at the akuma-tized woman. ""Okay... Now how are we supposed to get that pest with it literally around her neck?"" ""Well, my lady, that""s where you""re amazing brain power comes in."" He winked at her, causing her to groan. ""Don""t worry, I""ll distract her."" ""Chat, no-"" He stepped forward. ""Dessert? Well I don""t know. I""ve never been partial to sweets- especially overly sweetened ones."" Chat taunted. ""Maybe you should quit while you""re ahead?"" ""You take that back, my culinary skills are the best!"" ""Then prove it."" Chat launched, pointing his baton at the chef-akuma. ""How about some cream puffs, kitty cat?"" Calamity snarled swinging her whisk in a downwards arc at the Chat. Magically, four cream puffs appeared, all coming in like Chat-seeking missiles towards the leather clad hero. He leaped, dodging two, while deflecting two harmlessly to the ground. ""Merci, mademoiselle, but this kitty doesn""t do handouts."" With a shriek, Calamity swung her arms in successive strikes upwards, downwards and diagonally. Cream puffs, multi-flavored gateaux, and cupcakes, flew at the hero and he dodged them all, until she sent a sudden wave of- ""Chat!"" Ladybug called out. ""Is this ...ice cream?!"" Chat shuddered as the cold substance encased his legs, immobilizing him on the floor. Calamity smirked. ""I call it my creme glace. Not quite ice cream, not quite hard cream."" She looked smug about it. ""You""re the first customer for it. And now, you""ll be its first victim too."" She swiped diagonally again, sending another arrow of creme glace at the immobilized hero. This is gonna be cold, Chat thought. Suddenly, Ladybug leaped in front of him and swung her yo-yo in its shield forme. The creme glace attack reflected off the surface of the shield and back towards the akuma, hitting her in the face. ""What am I going to do with you, kitty?"" Ladybug sighed. ""Date me, eventually marry me, and have three kids named Emma, Felix and Aimee?"" he suggested with a waggled of his eye brows. At the droll look she gave him in response, he relented. ""We can negotiate the names later. CATACLYSM!"" The dark chaotic power glowed around his fist and he pressed his knuckles to the creme glace. The sweet and cold confection dissolved and Chat was free again. ""We are so not talking about this later..."" Ladybug muttered. ""LUCKY CHARM!"" She called and tossed her yoyo in the air. A red black-polka-dotted bowl fell into her waiting arms. ""Seriously, Lucky Charm? A mixing bowl?"" Calamity finally managed to get the creme glace off of her face, scowling at Ladybug. ""Now you""re finished!"" She swung her whisk in a downward arc and more cream puffs materialized. ""Puff alert!"" Chat called out before batting them away from his lady. ""Anytime you want to in form me of the plan you have, M""Lady.",3439302

This time, he sunk almost immediately into sleep. Just as his eyelids fell shut, he thought he saw a flash of something white, but it disappeared, and he was lost in the realm of sleep. For once, Percy had no dreams. No flashes of Gaea""s forces or of Nico and the others, just darkness. He was floating in it. It wrapped around him like blanket and squeezed, suffocating him.

Cold sweat dripped down the back of his neck. ""Percy,"" Annabeth whispered above him. He turned and saw that she was gripping his shoulder. With a start, he realized that she must have woken him. ""What is it?"" His words slurred; he was still groggy. She didn""t answer, just nodded in front of them. Turning again, Percy saw that they were surrounded by maybe fifteen ghostly figures. They differed in shades. Some were nearly transparent; Percy had to focus to even see their vaguest outlines, but others looked practically solid, the only hint that they weren""t just human were the slight blurring around the edges of their forms. One of the more solid looking ones stepped forward. Percy was sure that he had seen him before, but where eluded him. The ghost was dressed like an ancient Greek hero, and he looked a bit like Ares, tall and buff. Even their dark closely shaved dark hair was the same. The biggest difference between the two were their eyes. Squinting, Percy looked into the very human green eyes. Suddenly, he remembered. ""Achilles,"" he breathed. Annabeth looked at Percy incredulously. ""Achilles...?"" She glanced at the ghost then back at Percy as if silently asking him where he had met one of the most famous Greek heroes. Achilles didn""t acknowledge Annabeth at all, just stared at Percy. ""So, we meet again, Perseus Jackson. I see you no longer bear my curse."" Percy got to his feet. Even if Achilles was a Greek hero, there something about his cruel features that Percy didn""t trust. He moved to stand between Annabeth and the ghost. He drew Riptide from his pocket, but left it capped, ready to use the sword at any moment. ""Percy,"" Annabeth said wearily. ""If that is Achilles..."" she trailed off, but he understood her full meaning: If this was Achilles, he didn""t stand a chance. Maybe when he was if he still had Achilles"" power, but now... Still, he stood his ground. ""What do you want?"" Percy asked. Then, another question occurred to him. ""What are you doing here? You weren""t sent to Tartarus when you died, right?"" Achilles looked Percy over, sizing him up. ""No. This is a place reserved for monsters. When I died I went to Elysium. But the she called to me..."" he didn""t elaborate, just held up his hand and marveled at it, as though surprised that it was there. ""She whispered secrets into my ear.",2943978
755,"While better sense told him they should stop, this should and could wait, part of him that feared the future told him to press on, that he might never get this chance again. He listened to that part of him as he continued undressing Olivia. She was so beautiful. His lips moved to follow the trail his hands pioneered across her body. He had always loved the pursuit of knowledge and right now he wanted to learn which spots made her moan and which ones made her scream. Olivia alternated between breathy sighs, delicious moans and gasps of his name as he explored her skin, only her underwear remaining on her body. He moved to cup her breasts in his large hands, enjoying the heavy fullness of them in his palms. Olivia""s head fell back into the pillow as her back arched, pressing her more firmly against him. In response, Jacques bent his head to begin kissing the tops of her breasts not covered by her bra. Olivia""s fingers began to comb through his hair and Jacques"" tongue dipped under the edge of the lace trim. With her back still arched, one of his hands reached around and with one hand, he unhooked her bra. ""My, my,"" Olivia gasped, clearly impressed. Jacques did his best not to look too proud of himself, but he was quite happy to have impressed her. Slowly, reverently, he slipped down the bra straps to remove the garment from her pale, perfect skin. He didn""t want to stare, but he couldn""t help it. She had perfect breasts, his Olivia. His head bent down again as he captured one perfect nipple with his lips, using his teeth and tongue to pebble the bud as she writhed beneath him. He gave her other one the same delightful treatment. Jacques began to move down her stomach, but Olivia gripped his shirt, pulling him up with more strength then he would have guessed she had. She kissed him again, rougher this time, biting his lips gently as she rolled him onto his back. ""You are entirely overdressed, Mr. Snicket."" He couldn""t very well argue with her, as she was only in her panties while he""d only removed his coat. He let her do as she willed. Her treatment followed his, as she undressed him slowly, but with purpose, kissing and caressing him, as he laid back and enjoyed the feel of Olivia""s soft, slender hands and full lips tracing every part of his body. Thoughts of everything except this woman left him. When she had him in the same state of undress she was in, she moved back up to capture his lips again. They kissed. Jacques felt Olivia""s hand move down his chest, across his stomach and then beneath his jockey shorts to grip him. Stroke him. He broke away from her to let a loud moan. She smirked at the sound, which slightly embarrassed him, but not enough for him to stop her. Instead, he breathed out her name, ""Olivia."" Her hand moved faster. When he was close to truly embarrassing himself, he pulled her hand away. He put both her hands above her head and rolled her beneath him once more. He kissed her again.",1497577
438,"""I guess I should. I mean, this isn""t the first time Maurice has slipped up..."" He gave a decisive nod. ""I will. Let me get Colette so she can hear it too."" Mari followed. ""I""ll come too."" She had a bad feeling this was going to require Ladybug help. AK: Here""s a two-for, because for the next two weeks, I""ll have to put everything on pause for my final exams. College... R&R Adrien had a bad feeling in the pit of his stomach that Chat Noir would have to make an appearance soon at the Grand Paris Hotel. ""Hey, Mari""s kind of late..."" Eli noticed. ""Maybe I should go get her."" Adrien perked up. Having both Eli and Mari wandering around the hotel would make his and Ladybug""s efforts to purify the akuma much harder. Better Chat get his princess out of danger before the akuma-du-jour decided she was fair game. ""I""ll go get her. She probably got lost."" ""I can go."" Eli protested. ""I know the hotel better than you. If you both get lost, it could mean, uh, missing out on Chloe""s interesting story about Milan""s fashion week."" Chloe perked at the mention of herself and Milan. ""Oh yes, Eli-poo, I must tell you about the amazing dress maman bought me. Right off the runway! A Patiste original."" Adrien winced as he crept away slowly, noticing Eli""s face paling at the mention of Puke-tiste. Even if he wasn""t the most devoted fashion expert in the world- that honor he secretly gave to his princess- he was definitely aware of the monstrous creations that spawned from Chloe""s favorite abstract designer. His work was lauded as ""cutting edge"" and ""art for motion"", but it honestly looked as if the guy was color-and-pattern blind. Seriously, even Lady Gaga wouldn""t wear his Ode to the Food Pyramid dress! He made it to the hallway just as Alya was beginning to rip into Chloe for off-handedly putting down Mari""s outfit. He would have loved to stay and defend his quiet friend, but he had a feeling Alya had it covered, in spades. He reached the supply closet down the hall and released Plagg from his shirt pocket. His black kwami flew out in a huff. ""Mon dieu! If I have to keep listening to that blond girl tirades, I""ll go def. I""m adding extra cheese to your bill."" He floated in front of the kid""s face, pouting and huffy. No one could ever call Plagg a happy kitty- mostly because not many people knew about him. ""No time for negotiation, Plagg. I think we have a brewing akuma on our hands."" the blond model told his partner. ""Plagg, CLAWS OUT!"" He punched out his fist. ""Wait, wait- At least give me cheese! I""ll sue-"" The black kitty creature was sucked into Adrien""s silver ring and the boy felt the change take over him. The magic raced over his torso and limbs, culminating in his hands, and forming the claws that he loved to use to defend Paris- and his Lady. Suited up in his leather armor, he burst from the closet, ready to save his princess from the looming danger. He searched the floor and found nothing. Figuring he could head her off with the stairs, if he ran at top speed, he burst into the stairwell.",3439302
478,"Haymitch turned to Chaff, ""See. She""s very annoying."" Chaff shrugged. ""I watched her running away in those heels, and I still think you""re overreacting."" The bartender brought over some coffee for Haymitch. He barely took a sip, when Effie was back with a bottle of cologne. She began spraying around his face, Haymitch cried out, ""Stop that. You""re getting it in my mouth."" She sniffed around him. ""It""s a little better."" She shoved some mints into his mouth and then dragged him away, as he finished the coffee as quickly as he could, placing the cup on the bar on his way out. Alone in the elevator making their way up to the sponsors"" room, Effie gave her last instructions, ""You will go try, Haymitch."" She said firmly. ""You will try to save that boy""s life."" Haymitch, sobered up a little now, realized that she was right. He pushed out the memories from his early years as a mentor when he had really tried, before it grew to be too much and all the time alone in the Victor""s Village caught up with him, making him realize just how alone he was. How alone he would always be now. But he would try and then try not to mind when he inevitably failed. The sponsor she had lined up turned out to be an older man. Before coming up here, Haymitch had assumed Effie had somehow used her looks and a possible promise of sleeping together to get someone to talk to her. Within a few minutes though, Haymitch realized this man""s interest wasn""t in Effie. He continuously talked about the Seam boy""s pretty eyes. Haymitch struggled not to throw up on this man""s pretty suit and part of him would have done it gladly. But he didn""t want to deal with the fallout from Effie. Finally the older man said, ""Send the boy some bread."" ""Actually, I get to decide what he needs."" Haymitch reminded him. With a firmer tone, the man repeated, ""Send the boy some bread."" Haymitch understood the man""s attentions all too well. He also knew that if the boy somehow made it through what the Capitol would do. This was why he hated courting sponsors; they reminded him that there were worse things than a career""s spear through the chest. Back in the penthouse, Effie was happy to see the bread, as was the boy, and nearly hugged Haymitch until the look he gave her stopped her cold. The earthquake was what ultimately killed their last tribute. The boy had been trapped under some rocks. As he was still alive, Effie tugged on Haymitch""s sleeve. ""Do you think that the sponsor would send him something? Could he still live?"" Haymitch thought that the man might, but refused to indebt the boy like that, so he answered, ""No. There""s nothing we can do."" Effie looked very distressed by this news and watched until a few hours after, the cannon sounded, as the boy""s heart beat had stopped. Haymitch barely reacted, but Effie let out a gasp. It didn""t take long for her to recover though, ""We""ll just have to try harder next year."" ""That""ll work,"" Haymitch grumbled under his breath. Effie ignored him, ""Well, I""ll call the family."" She got up, but Haymitch stopped her. ""They won""t have a phone."" ""Oh.",1497577
2851,"""We have to head to the Association first."" he said. Inside Sitch""s office, the blond man was sitting on his chair with his arms crossed. Tatsumaki was slightly concerned, but Saitama""s thoughts were wandering about the upcoming sales for the week. ""Look, the newspaper""s article was pure bullshit. I assure you that. Caped Baldy and I are friends and I-"" ""I just wanted to congratulate you two! I know that it isn""t any of the Association""s business but it""s great that two of you got along really, really well."" Sitch said with smile. Though in reality, he was really glad that someone could ""tame"" the petite esper. The Association always considered Tatsumaki as a threat waiting to happen because of her temper plus her powers. Having someone like Saitama by her side would take the problem off their hands. This time, Saitama""s attention was full on Sitch while Tatsumaki could only blink in response. ""What?!"" the two heroes said in unison. ""You called us here just to say that?"" Saitama said, confused. ""But I just told you, the article is full of lies! We are not dating! I swear!"" Tatsumaki said, her face slightly red. ""Now, now Tatsumaki-san. No need to get embarrassed."" ""I. Am. Not. Fucking AROUND!"" she exclaimed, her hands glowing green. ""Uh... she""s right. We really aren""t dating. We""re just friends."" Saitama said, hoping it would calm the esper down. ""Oh. I see, I see. The press misunderstood, perhaps?"" ""Totally misunderstood everything."" ""Uh-huh. Well, this happens all the time, you know. We can contact the newspaper company, but we don""t know if it""ll do anything. The press isn""t really reliable, you know?"" Sitch said. ""Exactly!"" Saitama responded, slightly glad that someone shares his opinion. ""Well, I glad you two cleared things. I""ll be seeing you then."" Sitch said, dismissing the two heroes. As the two went out of his office, Saitama sighed heavily. ""Man, the press will do anything for a good scoop huh?"" the bald hero said. ""...you""re not even mad at the press?"" Tatsumaki asked, her tone a tad different from her usual, frilly voice. ""Why would I be? It""s a waste of time. Just let them say whatever they wanna say. It""ll die down in no time. If we get all defensive and stuff, wouldn""t the public just think that the article is true because of our reaction?"" he said casually as the two of them walked out of the headquarters. ""I guess you""re right."" she replied. As the two got out of the quarters, civilians around the place started to notice their presence. ""Hey, aren""t those two heroes dating?"" ""I heard that the bald dude""s only using Tatsumaki""s fame to rise up the ranks. He used to be a C-class right? Look at where he is now."" ""Isn""t he the hero who""s a scam because of his sudden raise in the rankings? Is this the reason why?"" ""Man, he is such a cheat."" ""Tatsumaki could do better that that."" ""You know that I heard? Tatsumaki was the one willing to raise this nobody""s ranks up."" ""Yeah, remember that clown incident?",2750536
3465,"The palace shook and rumbled, both from the two titans fighting and from the ongoing battle outside, the Emperor could feel through his immense psychic powers that his loyalists were had killed off the last of the untainted rebels and that the chaos tainted traitors could be used to drag the battle on for a few more days; try to make things look more exciting for the Remembrancers. The Emperor was drawn out of his contemplation when Horus chopped off Leman Russ""s head. Almost comically, the Emperor ducked while the dead Primarch""s head sailed over and bounced off the golden throne. The tall, dark haired man didn""t pay a second glance at his dead son Leman Russ, instead focusing his attention on the charging behemoth coming at him full tilt. Horus raised his power sword, ready to cleave his father in half; all traces of doubt and fear gone from him. Yet as he prepared to commit patricide, there was no hate in his heart, no hate for the man who""d tried to turn him into a demon finger puppet. In a way, this was a mercy killing; saving the memory of his treasured father from the man that he really was. The retaliation was swift and brutal, the Emperor swung at Horus with a great flaming sword, pulled seemingly from the ether. The impact of the Emperor""s blade with his own shook every atom in Horus""s body and threw him back. Horus didn""t feel the impact right away; his father struck him with such force that he only started feeling pain several seconds after he""d been hit. Golden coloured walls adamantine exploded and were ripped down as Horus flew straight through them. In an epic act of destruction, Horus crashed through walls and chambers beyond number. By the time that momentum ran out, he""d been knocked over five hundred kilometers from the central throne room. Rubble and dust cleared as Horus""s vision finally returned to him. Rolling over, his power armour fell apart and crumbled off of his body. The bronze skinned, bald headed Primarch groaned as he thumbed the switch on his chainsword. A buzz and a vibration confirmed that his weapon was working, one bit of good news today. His healing factor had barely even begun to start working on his numerous internal and external injuries when he heard the footsteps of an impossibly tall man. Footballs reverberated like the approach of a fairy-tale hero. The handsome prince stepped over his fallen son, looking to offer him redemption. After all, why waste resources? That""s something that chaos would do. ""My boy, my precious boy; you""ve fallen so far,"" the Emperor comforted his son as he put the point of his sword over Horus""s throat. ""You were my favoured son; I chose you over Guilleman or Dorn and all of your brothers to be my warmaster. I think that my withdrawal from the crusade threw you off balance; in the future I won""t give you that same rope to hang yourself. But even after all the pain you""ve caused me and the choices you""ve forced me to make I think I can forgive you."" Horus spat out a wad of blood and mucus as he met his father""s aura enhanced gaze.",1220273
3496,"""..that Honnoji Academy""s First Annual Ensemble Escalation..."" Muscles tensed as Omiko and Takaharu prepared themselves. ""BEGIN!"" The word was the trigger the boxer and tennis player had been waiting for. They started up so fast, in fact, that the wind-force created from their running actually managed to knock aside three of the other No-Stars. The unfortunate individuals were sent flying off into the sunset, their chance at a winning a One-Star Goku Uniform gone just like that. Sanageyama simply laughed in delight as Takaharu and Omiko simultaneously ran past him, the wind blowing back his hair and the folds of his jacket. Next to Gamagoori, Inumata began typing away rapidly on his laptop, eager to record the miles per hour of the contestants. Gamagoori watched with diligent eyes, seeing promise in Takaharu and nothing but arrogance in Omiko. Next to Inumuta, Jakazure simply looked on, her snarky smile making it seem she was uninterested, when in fact she was very much eying the action going on between Takaharu and Omiko. Of course, she had little to no idea just how intense it was between them. For the boxer and the tennis player, from the moment Sanageyama had announced the start of Ensemble Escalation, the concept being friends meant nothing Because in that moment, it was only Takaharu and Omiko against each other. Boy against girl. Boxing against tennis. Racket against gloves. Terms didn""t really matter at this point. What mattered, was that by the end of this, one of them would have that One-Star Uniform waiting atop the Covered Conquest Tower, and one of them would have nothing. Thus, there was but one thought that crossed both of their minds at the same time. The star would be theirs, and no one, not even their so-called friend, would stop them. And that""s what I call a cliffhanger! I""m horrible, I know. So what does this mean for our intrepid tennis player and boxer? Will Takaharu ever be able to admit his true feelings? Will Omiko ever forgot her past as Jaws-chan? Will the author ever finish this story? Alas, only time will tell. You""ll have to stay tuned, and wait for the next chapter. ;) And the chapter you""ve all been waiting for is here! All your waiting will hopefully be well rewarded in this chapter! We arrive at the Ensemble Escalation! Who will come out on top, with their first One-Star Goku Uniform? The sharp-toothed tennis player, Omiko Hakodate? Or the short screaming boxer, Takaharu Fukoroda? Well, looks like you""ll have to read on to find out! Enjoy, and be sure to review! - KILL AVANT KILL - EPISODE 7: EYE OF THE TIGER Speed became almost inconsequential as both Omiko and Takaharu put themselves into overdrive. They didn""t feel the wind against their face, nor did they pay any attention to the hooting and hollering of those No-Star students not involved in the Ensemble Escalation. No, they were much more focused on each other. Both the tennis player and the boxer both made note to glance at the progress of the other as they closed the gap to the Covered Conquest Tower.",967934
1872,"Joey shook her head and grunted something under her breath causing Dawson to look up, he smiled and waved at Jen who was making her way over to them. ""Be nice Joey"" Joey hit Dawson on the shoulder playfully and waved at Jen once she walked up to them. ""Hey Joey, Dawson. You guy seem awfully cozy"" Jen smiled, showing that she was only playing around. Jen looked at Dawson and then to Joey and saw something between them. ""Where""s Pacey?"" Joey felt her throat dry up at Jen""s question. ""I wouldn""t know he dumped me"" Joey hefted her backpack on her left shoulder and turned to Dawson before leaving. ""Meet you at lunch?"" Dawson nodded, she smiled and walked off to history class. Dawson watched her leave, his eyes watching her for the longest time, they only advanced to Jen once she cleared her throat loudly. ""He dumped her? Why?"" Dawson put his backpack on and bit his bottom lip not knowing how to really describe the whole situation Jen, it was the kind of situation where you had to be there to understand it. ""It""s complicated"" With those two words Dawson walked off towards English class. Jen watched Dawson leave and then turned to Jack who had made his way over to her. ""Oh great. Joey and Dawson are going down that path again."" Jack looked at Jen confused. ""What path?"" Jen pulled Jack with her. ""The path to disaster. They are falling in love with each other again, well they never stopped loving each other but they are going down that path again, they""re going to give their relationship another try"" Dawson looked up at the clock and smiled relieved when he heard the class bell ringing telling him that the class was over. Dawson grabbed his books and practically ran out of science class, he didn""t want someone to ask him to stay back, he just wanted to get out. He had felt Pacey staring at him throughout the whole class, he felt Pacey""s eyes burning a hole in the back of his head. Dawson looked at his watch and smiled again, it was lunchtime. Dawson walked into the cafeteria searching for Joey, he felt his heart skip a beat when he saw her, she was sitting at the cafeteria table that they used to sit at when they were going out, her hair was down from the ponytail and a few strands of her hair fell in her face, she stared down at the lunch. Dawson felt an old feeling enter his body, the feeling he used to have everyday when he used to be with her, he used to count the minutes until lunch, he would practically run out of class and into the cafeteria pushing people out of his way, and he would only stop acting like a maniac when he got to *their* table, it was like it was happening all over again and they weren""t even together. ""Hey there"" Joey looked up from her lunch and smiled big when she saw Dawson. ""Hey"" Dawson sat down next to Joey and pulled out a paper bag. ""You brought your own lunch Dawson? What happened to living through the school lunches because they were a part of the high school experience?"" Dawson took out a peanut and butter sandwich. ""I was a naive boy back then Jo"" Joey cracked a smile and pulled out a paper bag, Dawson laughed.",29783

1497,"Suddenly, people were leaving, and some even started running when they caught a glimpse of something from the one of the high rise window. Hungry beyond words and now quite annoyed as well, Sergeant Calhoun stood up and walked towards the window, with Felix just right behind her. ""Alright, alright, just what""s causing all this fuss?"" she asked loudly, only for Flo to appear right next to her, a worried expression on her face as she realized exactly what was going on. ""Oh dear. I knew there was a reason there were so many people in this game!"" ""What you mean?"" Felix asked, the rumbling only getting even louder as something huge shuddered the entire building with its bulk. ""I just opened my restaurant here. It seemed like a nice place to start a new business. But all this time I thought it was just an empty game!"" Flo practically yelled, as the rumbling threatened to drown out all other noise. ""Empty game? No game is empty! Where the heck are we, Felix?"" Sergeant Calhoun shouted, her tone of voice clearly showing her frustration. She got her answer though, when a massive hand, covered in brown fur, crashed through the wall of the building, reaching for whatever was within its grasp. It managed to latch onto the largest person within reach, which just so happened to be Sergeant Calhoun. As she struggled against its raw strength, and as Felix and Flo watched in terror, the creature truly revealed itself, climbing up into their view. What now held his dynamite gal hostage was the biggest gorilla Felix had ever seen. All Felix had to do was take on look at the bristling muscle hidden under his fur to know that Sergeant Calhoun wasn""t escaping any time soon. Still, that didn""t stop her from trying. ""Let go of me, you evolutionary has-been! Let go of me so I can fill that face of yours with all-you-can eat laser buffet!"" she threatened, though the gigantic monster simply ignored her, and in his grip she was unable to reach the spare gun that she had kept hidden in her dress this whole time. It was about this time that she was start to regret going with Felix to an unknown game without her armor and her rifle. Smiling through his massive canines as he looked at his new prize, George took one last look at Felix and Flo, before he continued his climb, with Sergeant Calhoun trapped in its unbreakable grip. ""No, no, no! That""s my date, you big monkey!"" Felix yelled in frustration, before turning back to Flo, who was still reeling in shock. ""You moved your restaurant into Rampage? What were you thinking?!"" he exclaimed, but Flo seemed to be in too much shock to give him much of a response. Clearly, she wouldn""t be much help. But as he turned around, he could see both Ulala and Beat, who besides himself and Flo, hadn""t run off in fear. ""Need some help? It""s been ages since we""ve been able to do something exciting."" Beat remarked. Ulala stood right by the skater, microphone in hand and her expression telling Felix that she was with him as well.",967934
203,"They were my childhood friends one year before you arrived to this city."" Both in turn nodded in confirmation. Rei patted at his side of the seat, staring at Yuuya. The blonde took it as an invitation, and in order not to shame Rei in front of the visitors, quietly sat beside him, arms on his lap and blushing a bit, his shame with new people still evident. ""So..."" Keough munched on a biscuit. ""...can you tell us about Yuuya? I""m mildly interested..."" He kept his eyes at Yuuya, the blonde looking away somewhat intimidated by Keough""s countenance. ""Yuuya moved in here one year since both of you left. We were in Grade six when we knew each other well. He was our neighbor formerly, but his parents had to move to the United States for their work. They entrusted him to us..."" Rei spoke monotonously. ""Yuuya..."" Masaaki looked at the blonde, catching his attention. ""...what was your first impression of Rei?"" Yuuya gapped a bit, not expecting to be asked. ""Uh...I...well..."" He stuttered a bit. ""Don""t be shy."" Masaaki smiled, his countenance reflecting comfort and security. Yuuya heaved a deep breath, and then spoke up. ""Uhm...I thought, for the first time I met him, he was a..."" Yuuya looked at Rei before turning back to Masaaki. ""...a snob."" He said, giggling softly in effect. Rei looked mildly affronted, Yuuya bought his hands in defense. ""Hey, hey! That was the first day! You see..."" He spoke, shame starting to loosen its grasp on him. ""...there was this first day at school and he was the one who""d have to accompany me there. That afternoon, I got confronted by bullies and I fainted on the spot! The next thing I know, Rei was there carrying me back to our house..."" Yuuya lowered his gaze on the floor. ""Since then, I wanted to become closer to Rei. He was my guardian...my protector. During those days, I was very mistrusting of my surroundings. But...Rei was different. I felt...secure around him."" Yuuya trailed off, his mind losing grasp of what he was saying. Rei just stared at him, a look crossing his face that showed satisfaction. ""I see..."" Masaaki sat back, taking another sip of his tea, his eyes glinting of something. He turned to Keough, the Australian giving a short nod with him in agreement. Rei turned his gaze at both of them, his eyebrow rising a bit from the reaction crossing between Keough and Masaaki. Something smells fishy around these two... ""By the way, can I ask a question?"" Yuuya shook up, turning his attention back to both of them. Both nodded. ""Why did you leave Shibuya? The both of you? One year before I came right?"" Yuuya sat forward, his curiosity piqued. ""Oh. That."" Keough laughed softly, sipping from his own cup. ""We had to go Edo to finish our studies in the schools our parents had taken, a family sort of tradition. "" Keough explained, waving his fingers in effect. Yuuya nodded, understanding a bit. ""Yuuya!"" Mrs. Otohata called from the outside. Yuuya excused himself for a while, shuffling to the door. Rei and the others looked at him, running up stairs and coming back down with a helmet on hand. ""I""m sorry, Rei.",583064
1258,"Like maybe I got the wrong impression, or... You hearing what I""m saying Harley?"" ""Please don""t call me that."" Harleen softly asked of him, he sighed. ""Honestly I wasn""t expecting you to be such a bummer, maybe I""ll just..."" His words trailed off and she felt like she could hear him grazing his thumb over the red button to disconnect the line. ""No."" She blurted out. ""I mean... You interest me and I wanted to find more out about you."" She saved, clenching her eyes shut, hoping he would accept that much. ""I do. Well that""s a first. Tell me, what do you think about me?"" She smiled brighter than she ever had before, laying down on the couch and staring up at the ceiling with a dreamy gaze. ""I don""t know much of anything about you. Maybe you could tell me about yourself."" ""I guess you could say my child hood wasn""t the best..."" ""Really? I""m listening."" Joker went on about his false child hood, how it was terrible, and how he had become what he was now. She fell for it, she fell for him. He would make a joke every so often and she would giggle, he liked listening to her giggle so he made as many jokes as he could. Most people wouldn""t laugh, but she having the sick sense of hummer, she did. In the end, she felt pity for him, she wanted to make him better and was convinced that he wanted the same. It was the Batman, he did this to him, and she hated him for it. It was midnight when suddenly she was getting tired. ""I love listening to your Voice Joker. It""s so husky and dominant."" ""Really? Well I love listening to your voice. It""s so melodic and soft."" She blushed at the comment, giggling again. ""I""m getting tired you know, but I don""t want to hang up."" ""Then don""t. Carry yourself to bed and leave the phone next to you. Who knows you might even get a surprise."" ""Why? So you could be creepy and hear my snoring? And What Exactly is this Surprise?"" She jested, standing up and migrating into her room. ""I""m sure your snoring sounds beautiful. Just lay down and I""ll be there in a minute."" ""What?"" He hung up when she was at the frame to her bedroom. A knock came at her door, she dropped the phone, looking down at her inappropriate attire. She rushed into her room, looking for her silk robe, but couldn""t find it. The knocking grew more insistent and she gave up, running to the door and opening it without second thought. She stilled at the sight of the Joker standing at her door, two goons standing on either side of him. He smiled at her with a shrug, stepping into the apartment and closing the door. He was so much taller than her, about one foot would be a probable estimation. ""You locked the door so I couldn""t get in."" He complained playfully, wrapping an arm around her waist and pulling her to him in a frolic type of manner. ""I like your underwear. It suits your personality."" Her lips kept parting and shutting, she didn""t know what to say, she didn""t know how to react, or tell him to get out. Honestly she was scared at what he could do, more than what he was... Insane. ""W-What are you doing here?"" She mumbled, her eyes wide with surprise.",6234395
1221,"It will definitely be sunny tomorrow especially now that I have decided: I am going to marry Yuna for Orb and forget everything about Athrun for myself. +To be Continued...+ So what do you think?

(I""m quite confused with this... so if anyone would be kind, please explain this more! please!) Athrun doesn""t like him, of course. In episode 13, Cagalli decided to marry him. I""ll leave it to you to discover what happened next. Ja! miriae Well, people, here""s the last part of this fic Hmmm.. will it end happily or sadly? Hmm... s s It is really an extraordinary thing to love. The bliss it gives you is unnerving- the blushes, the silent peeks, the unspoken words, the smiles and endearing words. And when all had been said, you""ll come down the isle and promise never to leave each other""s side. But is it possible to come down the isle without experiencing those? Yes, it is. Which is why I didn""t feel weird with what was happening now: I was walking down the isle, the wedding march playing in my ears, the white silky material that hugged my body trailed down behind me. Cameras clicked and flashed and all I had to do was let my happiest smile graze my lips. I was going to marry someone I don""t even love. Love was just a feeling for the weak- this is what he always told me. He told me that in order to help my country, I needed to do sacrifices. Before, I was confident with sacrifices. I was even capable of throwing my life for others. I wasn""t afraid of death. But now, the stakes of this sacrifice was just too great. I couldn""t just throw away my feelings for the person I love, it was just... too much to ask for. I know Athrun doesn""t love me anymore. I should be grateful, isn""t? It makes this sacrifice even easier. I would only be the one to suffer. At least, my sufferings will not be in vain for I know that my country will benefit for it. ""Do you, Cagalli Yula Attha, accept Yuna Roma Seirin as your husband, in sickness and in health, for better and for worse?"" Deep in my heart, I hoped for Athrun... that somehow, he""d be here to break this wedding.. that somehow he""ll come and kick the ass of Yuna, carry me bridal-style and steal me away from here and we""ll leave happily ever after. But then, it only happens in fairy tales. ""I do..."" My feelings for Athrun didn""t matter anymore. This is my battle and I have chosen my answer. In one way or another, I still hope to believe that love isn""t just for the weak. s s Chapter 3 ""Cause we""ll find the way s s It was one of those days when she loved the rain.

1350,"""Not really,' he answered, ""My mother""s kind don""t need much sleep. Thanks for defending me, by the way.' ""No one, even a prince, has the right to insult either myself or those I love,' she said, laying her head on his shoulder. ""Are you sure of your feelings for me, Princess?' Magnus asked, ""We""ve only known each other for a short time.' ""I""ve never been more sure of anything in my life,' she said. ""I love you Magnus, and I want you to stay with me.' Behind the couple, a solitary sniff, and a heart that ached with bitter sorrow lay listening with his mind. His secret power hidden from even the strongest magic wielders. Suddenly, cracks in the earth opened, and sand began to pour into the cracks. The breaks widened, and long, clawed hands reached up for the surface. Their master spoke to them through the wind, ""Kill the others, but leave the Princess alive.' ""Magnus!' Gem said, pointing to the hands, ""Do you see that?' ""I do!' he said, drawing his dagger. He leaped to his feet, and yelled, ""Alarm! Alarm!"" The others jumped up from their slumber, grabbing their weapons (or looking for a hiding place in a certain Grass Runner""s case) and they stood together, to face the creatures under the burning sands. The monsters that arose were gruesome indeed. Eight feet tall, three horns protruding from their brows, and tongues a mile long hanging frothier limp jowls, acidic saliva dripping to the ground. ""Kill them all,"" they growled, ""Leave Princess. Feast on Manflesh!"" they lunged and snapped their razor sharp teeth at the heroes. Magnus whirled around and kicked them away from Gemini. Orson stabbed one of them through what he assumed was it""s heart, but the thing kept coming. ""These things aren""t alive!"" Orso cried. ""That makes it easier then,"" Magnus said, slicing off one creature""s arm, ""If we can""t kill them, then we""ll just have to hack them to pieces."" ""Killin""s killin"" by my book,"" Gerrek said, chopping three creatures down the middle. Behind him, Ryna chopped and severed the heads of many sand monsters, while Greebus and Elska used magic to blast the beasts apart. ""This is a little too easy,"" Rayna observed. During all this, as Gem partook in the hacking, she heard the wind whisper across her ear. ""Princesssssssssss,"" it hissed. ""Who goes!' she cried in her mind. Then, she felt choke her throat. ""You have spirit, little Princess,' the voice that owned those said. ""But you cannot your destiny. You cannot escape me. I will have you, I will have Lodoss! You are mine..."" ""MAGNUS!' she cried in head. Magnus turned from the creatures, and sprang to the air. He saw the Princess on her knees, clutching at her own throat, struggling for breath. ""Gemini!"" he cried. ""Spirits of the Wind, silence this dark power which speaks through you. Release this girl from your spell!"" Then, the hold on Gem""s throat let go, and screamed away into the night, just as the last sand creature was decapitated. ""Gem?"" Leaf asked. ""Princess!"" Maar said, distraught, running over to her. ""Magnus, what happened?"" Elska asked.",512464
1650,"Pike let out a snort of laughter. ""Sure. Earning."" ""What""s that supposed to mean?"" Kirk asked. ""It""s not exactly earned if you""re cheating your opponents for all they""re worth."" ""I don""t know what you""re talking about."" Kirk insisted, raising his glass to lips, but before he could take a sip, Pike""s hand darted out and grabbed his wrist. Kirk looked at the older man in surprise. Pike just smiled and reached his free hand up to the edge of Kirk""s sleeve and pulled out a card. He flipped it in fingers so he could see it. ""Let""s see... ace of spades. Tell me again about your honest game,"" he said, releasing the other man""s wrist. Kirk smiled. ""I still earned it. If they""re too stupid to notice they""re being cheated they don""t deserve to keep their money."" ""Maybe, but I estimate they were about thirty seconds away from busting your ass. How long do you think it would""ve taken them to find this?"" he asked, holding up the card. ""I could""ve taken them."" Kirk said confidently, and with a jerk of his wrist finished his drink. Pike shook his head, but he could tell that Kirk was serious. The boy was fearless. That was good. He smiled, as he suddenly felt sure that he""d picked the right man for the job. ""I want you to rob a bank for me."" Kirk spluttered on the last of his drink. ""You want me to what?"" he asked coughing, but then continued without waiting for an answer. ""You""re crazy."" ""I heard you""re the best."" ""You heard wrong. You have to have done something to be the best. I""ve never robbed a bank. I can""t do it."" ""Your father could""ve."" Kirk refused to look at Pike. ""And look where that skill got him."" ""Fair enough,"" Pike said. ""But I knew your father well. He was one of the most brilliant men I""ve ever met. From what I hear, you""re a chip off the old block."" Kirk chuckled, looking down at the empty glass in his hands. ""Maybe."" He wiped his mouth on his sleeve. ""I still think you""re crazy."" Pike shrugged. ""Possibly, but I""m also about to be very rich, and I""m offering a way for you to be too."" He looked down at the bills sticking out of Kirk""s pocket. ""It""s a step up from cheating a few hundred bucks off couple of idiots in a backwater bar,"" he pointed out. Again, Kirk laughed. He looked up and asked, ""Supposing I took your offer, what would it entail?"" ""I""ve assembled a team of everyone we should need to pull off a bank heist, but I still need a leader. A mastermind if you will."" ""You""re crazier than I thought if you think that""s me."" ""I do,"" Pike answered curtly. ""Fine. But if I take your offer, I have one condition."" Pike raised an eyebrow. ""I never work a job without Bones."" ""Bones?"" ""Uh, Doctor Leonard McCoy,"" Kirk quickly amended. ""I fail to see why we""ll need a doctor..."" Pike said. ""He""s more than that. He""s gotten me out of more than a few tight scrapes."" ""Fine. Be at this address the day after tomorrow at three to meet the team. Bring Doctor McCoy,"" Pike said, handing him a small white business card. Kirk took it and flipped it in his fingers to read the address. Pike started to turn away, but the younger man stopped him.",2943978
2517,"Joe dabbed a towel over her face to help dry the sweat. ""Jeez, woman, where did you come from, you""re dripping buckets everywhere,"" Joe said, dabbing away. ""Oh, er- I live by Beach Boulevarde."" ""Explains a lot,"" Joe said. Beach was about a mile away- a very long mile if you were traveling by bike. He set down the towel and started on the foundation, pouring a small dot on the sponge. ""Cary- I- swear- to- God- I- am- going- to- kill- you-"" Charles gasped suddenly a few minutes later. ""Don""t blame me, man. I was just trying to motivate you!"" Cary gave his excuse. ""You asshole!"" Charles proceeded to chase Cary around the hill. ""Guys, quit screwing around! The sun""s coming up!"" Alice pointed. Pink rays were beginning to spread across the horizon. ""Fuck!"" Charles ran to his bag of equipment. ""Don""t just stand there, help me! Joe, are you done?"" ""Just about,"" he replied, hurriedly dashing foundation on Elle""s face. ""Good! Places! Cary, get your ass over here! Get your fireworks ready! Costumes, everyone! Go, go, go!"" There was a mad scramble of limbs and shouting and tangled feet. A box of film was snatched off the floor; Joe swung the boom mike around, connecting the leads. Everyone swarmed around the hill, searching through their bags, juggling equipment. ""Hurry, get that set up-"" ""Shut up, I am TRYING!"" Alice retorted, but there was no time to be surprised at her sudden reply- the sun was rising. The actors stood to attention. Joe held the boom mike out in front. Alice snapped the film casing shut and put both hands on the big black camera. Charles moved out of the camera""s field of view, tugged a pair of headphones onto his head. ""Ready? Alright. Aaaaand... action!"" So I""ll just end here today... I want to save the outcome of the movie for the very end. So... please don""t hate me... I have BIG plans for this story. It""s gonna be epic.

Martin squeezed his eyes shut, feeling his way around the locker room like a blind man. ""Jeez, Martin, calm down. Just change and get out,"" Charles told him. ""Or don""t,"" Joe suggested, twirling his lock. ""No, no, I want a grade for gym! Someone lead me to my locker..."" ""Why do I hang out with you?"" Charles sighed, pulling out a gray shirt and green shorts- Lillian High""s gym uniform. ""Hey, you guys! Check this out!"" Cary pointed to his shirtless form, revealing a monster drawn in a black magic marker. ""I did it in Mr. Dunn""s,"" he told them proudly. ""See, look, he breathes!"" he took exaggerated deep breaths. Joe shook his head at his friend""s antics. ""Whoa- whoa- augh!"" Charles fell to the ground attempting to put on his shorts. ""Smooth,"" Joe grinned. ""Shut up."" Charles heaved himself up.",2855986
486,"""Well, Dr. Smith was the Christenson""s family doctor; he took care of their daughter, Nephilim, her whole life..."" That was him?! I took in a sharp breath. I remembered him. Short with crew-cut brown hair and hazel eyes. A little on the plump side... He played cards with Nephilim and I on few times when me coming over accidentally coincided with one of his home visits. Hotchner""s eyes flicked to me for just a second, ""And, Garcia?"" ""Spence,"" Garcia closed her eyes for a moment, biting her lip. It had gotten tense; out of everyone there, Garcia was always the last to be visibly effected by anything. She always tried to keep on a happy face for the others. ""Spence,"" she repeated, opening her bright eyes slowly, ""I decided I should check. I didn""t think that... it would..."" Garcia was visibly struggling with words. She sighed again and shook her head. ""Just spit it out, babe,"" Morgan said in his best reassuring voice. ""Spence, the hospital records had Nephilim""s DNA from all her tests on file,"" She said quietly, ""Even a karyotype had been done. I... cross-referenced them to the other data and found something."" She fell silent. A second went by - why didn""t she just say it? - before I opened my mouth, ""Come on, Garcia; what is it?"" ""..."" She seemed to be shuffling around papers in front of her, breaking eye contact with all of us, ""I got some matches."" My eyes widened as far as they could, all traces of exhaustion wiped from my features. She had found something on her? Had her body finally been found? Maybe I could finally put it all behind me, finally get some closure and... wait... ""some matches?"" ""... Nephilim is the biological mother of all seventeen known victims,"" Garcia said slowly. She then started to gush out, ""Oh Spencer, I was scared to tell you, but wanted you to hear from me. From what you told us, it seemed you were really close to her. I am so sorry, Spence... Spencer?!"" I was already out of the room. What was this I was feeling? So many emotions, all bombarding my senses all at once. Anger; anger at that doctor. If he was the father of one of the dead newborns, and Nephilim the mother... she would never consent to it. I don""t know how I knew, I just did. That... that monster. Was he ""the oracle""?! Had he killed the Christenson""s?! Then relief. A relief so strong that I felt like I would collapse. She, as of nine months ago, was alive. Alive and breathing. According to the letter, another child was on the way. That meant... that she could still be alive, even now! Somewhere, some place, Nephilim was alive. Alive and - if the unsub was to keep their pattern - with child. But alive nonetheless. An overwhelming sense of helplessness. Thirteen years had passed since the death of Leah and Micheal Christenson. This whole time, even in the absence of a body, everyone had believed her dead. Her body was weak; there was no way she could survive without medication. Maybe had I not given up on the search... maybe if I had done something, none of this would have happened. None of those children would have died.",748687
1313,"We conversed for a little while until I heard the doorknob turn. I texted Matt back real quickly before I turned off my phone and looked up at the doctor. He was frowning as he continued to look at some x-rays. ""So Doc, do I get the stitches out today,"" I smiled happily over at him. He jumped when he heard my voice however he nodded and then replied, ""Yeah, we""ll be taking them out today, but that""s not why I made this appointment Miss. Phillips."" ""Well why did you,"" I asked politely as I could. The doctor walked over to the light board and set the x-rays up on it. He turned on the light and then turned back to me. ""Well, Miss Phillips, when the Campbells brought you in we took a few x-rays while you were passed out to assess the damage you had. At first when I was looking at these x-rays I thought maybe you just had a concussion, a blood clot maybe, but when I looked closer my nurses"" fears were confirmed. Miss Phillips does cancer run through your family,"" the doctor asked. I nodded my head and answered, ""Yeah, my great grandmother on my mom""s side has had it, my mom""s mother has had it, my mom""s father has had it, even my grandpa on my dad""s side has had it. It has ran through our family as long as I can remember. All of them recovered though."" ""That""s what I feared when I read it in your file that your family doctor faxed up to me. Miss Phillips, when we were looking at the x-ray""s we found a tumor. A small tumor, but all the same it was a tumor. Like I said before, we thought it had been because you hit your head, but when we looked closer the size and shape, was too unusual to be a blood clot or anything else,"" the doctor frowned finally meeting my eyes as he sat down in a chair. I felt my heart sink to my stomach and my breakfast about come back up. ""I have cancer,"" I asked covering my mouth with my hand as I felt tears well up in my eyes. ""Yes, but it""s treatable. We don""t know the extent of it though. We""ll know when we do the surgery..."" ""Whoa, whoa, SURGERY,"" I shouted looking up at him. ""Well yes, you""ll have to have surgery so that we can remove it, and asses how bad it is. For all we know it could have spread by now. Have you been having any headaches lately, or before you hit your head,"" the doctor asked looking over at me closely. I took a moment to think about it. I had been having frequent headaches lately, even before I hit my head. I thought it was just normal. I was prescribed glasses, but I rarely wore them unless I was reading or driving so I thought maybe that was why I had been having headaches, however, after hearing this, that thought flew out of my head. Eventually I nodded my head to his question. He wrote something down on his clipboard before looking back up when I cleared my throat, ""Um, I won""t have to have chemo will I."" That""s one thing I hated about the idea of cancer. That""s the one thing I hated watching Matt go through. That""s what made the cancer unbearable for people. I knew the moment I""d start it, I""d lose my hair, the one thing Matt loved.",806976

""Ready to go Brooke?"" Brooke nodded and kissed Mike on the cheek and hugged Jane and walked out the door right behind Sam who had taken a bite of the bagel. ""Josh said he would pick us up, he said he would pick up Harrison first"" Sam nodded and leaned against an old oak tree and turned to Brooke. ""It""s funny how things change---"" Brooke instantly lowered her eyes thinking Sam was talking about the events of last night. ""I mean a year ago me, you, Josh, Sugar Daddy, Harrison, Lily, Carmen, Nicole and Mary Cherry were in such a different place.

He absently cheered for his old friend Razor, as he dodged a Flamethrower and retaliated with a Razor Leaf and Bullet Seed combo. ""Now, hit ""em with a Leaf Blade!"" Ash, his human partner, cried. Razor nodded and followed up with a powerful Leaf Blade that made a direct hit on Misty""s Gyarados. ""I""m not giving up yet, Ketchum!"" Misty taunted. ""Gyarados, use Blizzard!"" Volt turned his attention back to Ivy who was now watching the battle. After relocating to a quieter place, he""d found out that Ivy loved Whip. Freakier still, she was trying to battle her emotions into submission and cushion the fall she knew her leafy heart would take when Whip eventually found a girl. But that he would choose Emi of all people. Whenever Volt saw her, she was flirting or using Attract on some unwilling male Pokémon. He was glad he""d found a girlfriend*. Ivy was slowly beginning to engross herself in the battle; her eyes losing that sad sheen that made Volt""s chest tighten with grief. Volt sighed with relief then went back to cheering for Razor. ""Go, Razor! Knock that guy back!"" Ivy"" Normal POV (Because you don""t want to know this girl""s thoughts): Ivy sat under the tree, watching the moon rise. ""So perfect."" ""I know."" Whip said, appearing beside her. She tensed. ""Look, I don""t have the appetite for your bitter words so just leave me alone."" Instead of listening to her plea, he took a seat next to her. ""The stars are so wonderful around here. You can really see them clearly, without all the city lights."" Ivy nodded. ""You can. And now, you can enjoy them alone."" She made a move to leave and he shot out a Vine Whip to restrain her. She frowned and called on her own vines to disentangle herself from the hold. She wouldn""t sit here with her defenses down. ""It""s getting cold; I""m going inside. Razor says I have an early day of training tomorrow; he""s asking Infernape to help me."" She didn""t know why she felt the need to tell him. She just did. Whip frowned at Ivy""s retreating back. He wanted to follow her, ask her what was wrong, hug her and then-and then what? Have Emi spew his secret all over the Unova region and then some? He wanted to use Thrash on himself, he was too confused. ""I thought I said this was private area, moss-brain."" The voice of Razor caught the usually calm Grass-type by surprise. Whip stared at the Forest King Pokémon as he sat beside him. ""I heard you..."" he mumbled beside himself. ""You do realize sulking won""t get you the girl right?"" Razor suddenly said. Blushing, Whip turned his head away. ""I-I have a girlfriend..."" he defended weakly. ""That was pathetic. And your little plan to make Ivy admit she likes you first by dating Emi is even more pathetic."" Razor advised. Whip winced. Was it that obvious? Heck, he couldn""t believe he""d talk to Emi if it weren""t for Ivy. Taking his silence for a leeway, Razor went on. ""If Emi likes Volt, she should have told him so. Not that it would make much difference.",3439302
1795,"Him then transforms into a bestial satanic form like the one from the PPG episode ""Speed Demon"" Orel then falls on his knees and starts praying. Him looks down and says, ""I AM ABOUT TO ELIMINATE YOU AND YOU""RE PRAYING? And to who?"" Orel then says, ""To God and Jesus!"" Him then scratches his head and says, ""Ah, people from your mythology. TOO BAD NOT EVEN THEY CAN HELP YOU!"" Orel then tossed many bottles of holy water on Him and with each bottle would cause Him to shrink and scream in pain. Then Orel threw a cross at him and then as if something answered Orel, lightning strikes the cross on Him, frying him to near nothingness. Then in a flash of pink, blue, and green, The Powerpuff Girls arrived! Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup are shocked to see Orel defeated Him and Bubbles asked Orel, ""How did you do it?"" Orel then says, ""It was lord""s will!"" Blossom then says, ""Normally we don""t ever come to this town because it""s so creepy and has that 1950""s vibe but we came for Him! Oh and thanks!"" Orel then says, ""Ok, here""s the devil and make sure he never causes any trouble again!"" Buttercup then asks Blossom, ""What""s up with villians from Townsville coming to other towns, What""s next? Sedusa, Femme Fatale, and Princess in Aron City? They grab him and fly away. After Him vanishes, All of Moralton is restored back to normal and Clay is freed and runs and hugs his son and says, ""Oh Orel....after what the devil did to me, it made me realize all the things I""ve done will just come back to me and bite me where it hurts! Well son I kept my word... here""s ""THE KEY TO MORALTON"" You deserved it...do whatever you want!"" Orel then says, ""Ok...well... I... get to have Christina as a girlfriend despite how different she might seem. Clay gets angry and then stops and says, ""You got me there."" Then Christina runs and hugs Orel and says, ""Orel you did it! You made the devil go away, you""re a savior!"" Orel then says, ""Watch it Christina, I""m not THE savior...just one...Jesus did all the work!"" Then Orel says, ""And as ruler of Moralton I want parents to be good to their kids"". Carl and Kim Latchkey then nervously look at eachother and they forceably hug Doughy since it""s a law now, Doughy makes a huge smile after that. Orel then says, ""And my next act is...FREE PUPPIES FOR EVERYONE!"" And everyone got a free puppy. Clay then says, ""Well I see I made up for the all those rotten things and now you rule Moralton."" Orel then says, ""Not quite dad, there is one more thing... I""ll see you...IN MY ROOM!"" Clay then gulps. (Meanwhile at Orel""s house) Bloberta was cleaning the bathroom and when she opened the bottom sink she sees the Amoeba Boys Bossman, Slim, and Junior. Bossman then says to Bloberta, ""Ok youse, hand over da money and no one gets hurt, see?"" Slim then says, ""Yeah, see?"" Junior then says, ""Yeah... what he said see?"" Bloberta then pulls out ""Germ Killer"" and sprays it at the three, then they scream and run off from her. They end up in Shapey and Block""s room and Bossman then says, ""That was scary boys, When we get outta here, it""s back to stealing oranges!""",910821
1149,"I mean, he carried you into the EMT station and he kept his cool the whole ride to the hospital, he was by your bedside when you woke up and he has been working his butt off to try to find this creep so he can put that guy behind bars so he can never hurt you again. Jamie has been trying his hardest and yeah he lied and it was bad, but you don""t understand do you? Everything Jamie does, well he does it for you"" Tyler stared back at Catie for a few seconds before walking back into the school with a heavy look on his face. Jamie looked away from Val to see Tyler walking up to them. Jamie looked behind Tyler but his eyes found no trace of Catie behind him. ""Hey guys"" Tyler""s voice seemed tired and emotional, just like how he felt. Tyler ran his fingers through his hair and finally met Jamie""s eyes. Jamie""s eyes were pleading for an answer. ""I told her everything you told me, I mean everything Jamie"" Val looked over at Hank who had a still look on his face. He didn""t know how to really react. Everything about this situation made Hank sad and lost and he didn""t like that feeling. ""How did she take it? I mean, obviously she was upset, but how did she look?"" Tyler bit on his bottom lip and stared back at Val. ""She was more concerned with you lying to her. She seemed pretty upset about that, I thought she would follow me in here but she didn""t. So I don""t know"" Jamie shook his head. ""That""s all I needed to know, bye!"" Jamie took off running leaving a distraught Hank, Tyler and Val behind. ""Where are you going?"" Hank yelled after Jamie hoping he heard him. ""To Catie"" Jamie waved and flew through the doors and ran towards his bike. He hopped on without thinking twice about where he was going. He fastened his helmet on and sped off. Catie sat on the edge of a tall weepy tree. She had her knees drawn up to her chin and her arms were wrapped around her legs. Catie""s had her head resting on her knees and her hair was blowing in the wind. It was pretty cold outside but she didn""t really care, she just needed to be somewhere quiet. ""I thought I would find you here"" Catie didn""t dare to look up. She didn""t need to. She knew who it was, she knew it was Jamie; he was the only one who knew about her hiding spot. He was the one after all who had told her that they would need to find a secret hiding spot where they can go when things got too rough. ""Only you would since you are the only one that knows about this place, well you and the squirrels but I think they knew about the place before we did. The light brown one is a girl"" Jamie smirked and sat down next to Catie. ""What""s her name?"" ""Lisa. She""s a loner though. Her mom and dad don""t really pay that much attention to her and she doesn""t have a lot of friends. She has two real good friends though; they""re her best friends. She got into a bad accident two weeks ago, she was stabbed and one of her best friends lied to her about it and now she can""t trust anyone"" Jamie looked over at Catie. ""Maybe the one good friend that lied to her about it, never meant to hurt her. Maybe that was far from his list of intentions.",29783
2123,"Demo has her explosives, chemicals and tools are categorized with OCD neatness and there isn""t a single non-functional thing around. Even the desk and chair are the cheapest things picked out of an Ikea catalogue with no mind for comfort or aesthetics. Behind her desk, Demo adjusts the blindfold that""s covering her eyes. Briefly, a nasty looking stripe of scar tissue is revealed; whatever is under that blindfold is best unseen. Her scarred and oft burnt and broken fingers adjust the fisherman""s cap on her head and shift some of her unwashed, greasy hair where she likes it. ""I""m sorry about killing your comrade"" she begins, with only the faintest hint of an accent; just the smallest difficulty with her ""l""""s. ""I meant to hit Scout in the head but my aim was off."" With her apology out of the way, Demo starts to explain her job. ""I am a good Demo woman because I am alive. A good demolitions expert is anal, hates fun and has no hobbies. I don""t drink alcohol, smoke or eat meat. I am the best in my particular field and I don""t need eye sight to get my work done."" We not cut to the familiar sight of battle between the two merc teams. Heavy lays down supressing fire and bullets fly in every which direction but this time she gets mowed down by a sniper. The Blue sniper surveys her work from a tower, only for the tower""s foundations to blow and the sniper""s perch to tip over. Demo and Scout step through the dust, a submachinegun in each hand. Back in the interview, Demo holds up the wires she uses in demolitions. ""Each one of my wires is an identical color but has a different texture. As a result, the Blue team never knows which wire to cut when defusing my bombs."" At the battle, Scout lays down shotgun fire while Demo sprays everywhere with her submachine guns; mowing down an enemy engineer and driving back a soldier. Spinning around, she hears footsteps over the gunfire and blows away an approaching spy about to do a backstab. In her office, Demo points to the brass bells on her tactical gear. ""When I move, the bells make sound and that allows me to run at speed in unfamiliar environments. It""s not dissimilar to echolocation. Any human can do it, but it takes practice to use it like I do."" Demo is now running down the central corridor of the Blue base, brass bells chiming over the guns and explosions. She throws down sticky bombs to cover her tracks and slow down her pursuers. At the center of the Blue base, she begins to set up a device with a radioactive symbol on it. The Demowoman scratches under her blindfold. ""Yes, I""ve always been blind. I was born blind; so thankfully when my younger brother gouged out my eyes it wasn""t a big deal."" Demo walks away from the Blue base and casually hits a detonator. The entire blue base blows up, turning into a mushroom cloud that rises up at least a mile into the atmosphere. ""Holy shit!"" shouts a Scout blinded by the explosion""s flash. ""Did you use a nuke!?"" Demo smiles. ""Yes."" Back in the office, Demo gives a big grin. ""I took much worse from my brother than a pair of eyes.""",1220273
969,"Gem watched them leave, then, she lifted her clasped hands to her face, and smiled. Then she skipped away. ""Now where is she going?"" King Spark asked his wife. ""She has to get ready for her company, dear,"" Queen Neese said, taking his arm. ""remember when we were that young?"" ""Oh yes,"" King Spark said, ""I fell in love with you the minute I saw you."" ""Now, I wish for such happiness to come to Gemini."" Queen Neese said. But inside her heart, she secretly feared. She hoped that her daughter would never have to endure such hardships as Neese had, in order to gain her true love. Yet still? That nagging feeling. ""Oh Marfa, Mother of the Earth,' Neese prayed in her mind, ""Place your protection around my daughter? and whoever this young man may be.' Transition ""Now you""ve done it!"" Maar cried as the soldiers encircled them. ""Why couldn""t you just leave that girl alone! But NO! You had to go and spark with the Princess!"" ""I didn""t know she was a Princess, alright!"" Magnus cried to all of them. ""Come on, guys, I""m just a wandering minstrel, what does the king want with me?"" ""Never mind that, just come along,"" said the captain. ""Oh d----! This always happens, one way or another! Now I""m going to have to do it to these poor people too!"" Magnus despaired. ""Do what?"" Maar asked, afraid. ""This,"" Magnus sighed. He drew his dagger- the one thing he hated most of all, and was the only other thing he was good at- and the last thing his father gave him before he disappeared- and charged at the men. He waved the sharp weapon around, making sure not to actually hit people, and started to make a break for it. ""Manner of all creation, become a chain to bind him!"" cried the tall man in fur from that morning. A chain of light headed straight for Magnus. ""Spirits of Water, become a sword to break the chain!"" Magnus called. The Water Spirits appeared, and grasped the chain, break it asunder. ""Careful!"" the man in furs said, ""This is more than just any normal Half Elf! He has the Spirit of the High Elves within him! His magic is powerful, and he will not be easily conquered. ""Then let me try,"" said a young girl. Magnus looked at her, and was stunned at her ears. She was a Half Elf too! He couldn""t fight one of his own kind! What would his mother say? ""Spirit of the Wind, become arrows to pin this boy!"" the girl cried. The wind spirits rained down on him, and pinned him to the back wall. He could not move, though he struggled. ""You fought bravely, son,"" said the man with the scar. He carried a kicking and whining Maar under his arm. ""Come on, guys! I thought we were all old friends here?"" Maar cried. ""Shut up, Maar,"" the man with the scar said. ""You didn""t have to run from us."" ""I didn""t! He""s the one who fought you guys! That Magnus guy!"" ""So much for fellow musicians,"" Magnus sighed. ""Mother and Cecil were right. I had no future beyond the village. Now I""m probably going to hang, and all because I""m a nice guy."" ""Wait a minute,"" the man in fur said, ""You know Cecil? The Wizard?"" ""Yeah, from the time I was a small child.",512464
1616,"Mikasa could only nod shyly, she could feel her cheeks burn up. The two childhood friends didn""t know where to place their gazes, feeling a bit awkward within each other""s presence. Eren kept on scratching the back of his head, even though it wasn""t really itchy whilst Mikasa kept her gaze on the ground. In short, the two looked like a scene straight from a corny teenage movie. The moment was right, they were in a secluded area, the wind blew gently, the crickets hummed softly, the stars twinkled brightly and they were alone. Everything seemed perfect- THUD Except for a noise that startled the both of them. ""Oh god, Springer you idiot. You only had one job and that was to stay completely still!"" Ymir said, glaring at Connie. ""What? I did, but then Sasha was busy eating this steamed potato that fell on my head! I thought it was a beetle or something..."" Connie reasoned as he massaged his head. ""It""s not like it fell from my hand on purpose! My hand cramped up from staying still-"" Sasha said as she held her other hand gently. ""Shut up! If only you""d left that damn potato back in the kitchen! The corporal might punish us, y""know!"" Jean yelled back. ""Shh! Be quiet horse-face!"" Ymir said. ""I told you guys to not bring these two along."" Annie muttered. ""It can""t be helped, they""re here."" Reiner answered. ""Uh guys... we""ve been found out."" Armin meekly said, making everyone stare at the Mikasa and Eren spontaneously. ""Ah... hey Mikasa, Eren."" Krista softly said with a small wave, the guilt obvious in her voice. Meanwhile, the two childhood friends could only stare at their classmates, not knowing what to do nor say. ""What the hell are you guys doing here?!"" Eren shouted at their guilty classmates, feeling infuriated. Tonight was quite a night. Probably update in a week or two. Sorry for the late update, doods. College got the better of me hahahahahuhuhu. Do enjoy this really short chapter. ""Eren, you should finish your meal first before arguing with Jean."" ... ""Eren, stop fighting with Jean."" ... ""Eren, your maneuver gear""s not attached properly."" ... ""Eren-"" ""For fuck""s sake, would you stop Mikasa? I""m not your son nor your little brother so quit acting like you""re the boss of me!"" Eren finally said, as he was about to skip dinner. On the other hand, Mikasa shoved bread in his mouth, making him involuntarily eat. As the gang stared hopelessly at the two childhood friends, they even wondered if last night really did happen. They were back to their usual selves, with Mikasa acting like a doting parent and Eren being stubborn as a child. Armin could only sigh. There were no changes at all. Near the doorway, Squad Leader Hanji and Corporal Levi stood, with Levi glaring at the two with his arms crossed as he leaned on the doorway. Hanji was looking as bored as ever. ""We gave those idiots a chance and here they are. So fucking romantic."" Levi muttered. ""I guess that""s just how they show their affection huh."" Hanji said, her voice sounding a bit disappointed. ""That""s none of our concern anymore."" Levi said as he walked away from the dining hall.",2750536
2183,"""Now, it""s been a long day,"" Yami said, ""I believe we should et some sleep"". Just then, they heard the sounds of a motor car running against the stony yard outside. Yami rushed to the window, and his face went white. Then, he grabbed his head and cried, ""Dear God! What have I done to deserve this!?!"" ""What""s wrong master?"" Joegore asked worriedly. ""My fiancé just pulled up outside..."" Yami said in a voice that foretold doom.... DOOM! AN: =O What!?! Oh no!!! DOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMM!!!!! Please review.... AN: At the home stretch now, people! What will become of Dr. Yugistein and his monster? Read on to find out! Act Six: Scene One ""Darling!"" Tea said cheerfully as she leaned against the motor car. Yami and his assistants had just stepped out of the castle doorway. Yami looked dashing in his robe and ascot. ""Darling,"" he answered clapping his hands together. ""You""re here... I thought you would wait until I sent for you?"" ""Well,"" Tea explained, ""I got bored, and decided I""d surprise. Are you surprised?"" ""Very,"" Yami said through gritted teeth and an overly wide smile. ""Love me?"" Tea asked in a sugery voice. ""Love you,"" Yami replied. ""Well, it""s been a long day, shouldn""t turn it?"" ""Oh, but I just got here,"" Tea said. ""Would you get my things, dear?"" ""Of course,"" Yami said, he went around the back of the car to retrieve the luggage and tip the driver. With this chance too good to pass up, Joegore clapped his hands, and said, ""Darlin!"" He shuffled over to Tea and laid his head on her bountiful chest as he asked, ""How you doin"" ?"" ""Uh.. I..."" Tea stuttered, wondering how she could escape from this grotesque minion. ""Love me?"" Joegore asked in a mocking sugery voice. ""I... uh... I just met you,"" Tea reasoned. Just then, however, Yami came back around. ""Let""s just keep this between you and me,"" he said rolling his crossed eyes around. ""Certainly,"" Tea said as Yami stood in front of them. ""Joegore, take care of these,"" Yami said, throwing the suitcases at Joegore, who failed to catch them and went sprawling on the ground, covered by a mountain of brand name leather luggage. ""Yes master,"" the hunchback grunted from under the Italian bag. ""My dear, this is our housekeeper, Kikyo,"" Yami said. Lightening flashed, thunder clapped, horses reared, and Serenity screamed. ""And this excitable young lady is my lab assistant, Serenity."" ""You""re his assistant?"" Tea asked, eyeing Serenity suspiciously. ""Oh, I""m more than just his assistant,"" Serenity said, flaunting her womanly charms. ""I""m his lover."" ""His WHAT!?!"" Tea exclaimed. Behind her, Yami had been waving his arms around wildly to shut Serenity up- but it hadn""t worked- but Tea swung around and grabbed Yami by his scrawny neck . ""FIVE YEARS!!"" she screamed. ""Five years of my life I waste on you! Giving you devotion! I saved myself for you! And when I leave you alone for a week, and you hop in bed with the village IDIOT!?!?!""

1228,"Kahoko felt a pang of hurt at the obvious criticism. ""I suppose,"" Hamai Misa assessed slowly as she closed the lid of the piano. ""Very well, I expect you to guide her well, Len,"" she told her son as she moved towards the door and added, ""don""t push yourself too hard, Kahoko-dear."" Kahoko exhaled audibly when the door closed. She almost humiliated herself in front of the Hamai Misa! How awful it would be that a world-renowned pianist who had been so kind to accompany her for practice would see how clumsy she was of a violin player. And Hamai Misa had been very optimistic. She felt a growing uneasiness in her stomach. True, there were times that she played Chopin""s etude no.3 opus 10 even after Lily""s magic vanished. But it never felt the same as during the first selection. It felt as if something was missing. Glancing at the male violinist beside her, she groaned inwardly. This was going to be a long practice indeed. If Tsukimori Len was to assess Hino Kahoko""s playing, he would say that she really was improving. She hit the notes correctly-well, a little sloppily in some phrases-but still correctly. She was following each crescendo and decrescendo religiously, and her timing was almost perfect. This was why he could not understand why her shoulders slumped in disappointment as the last note reverberated from the violin. She sighed as she lowered the instrument. He didn""t really care, and yet-""what""s wrong?"" Sighing again, she fell to her knees, careful not to let the violin hit-not even graze-the floor. ""It just doesn""t sound the same."" Did she just insult his violin? The nerve of this woman! He raised his eyebrows. ""Like I""ve said before, that violin-"" ""No, no, it""s not the violin,"" she clarified hurriedly. ""I mean..,"" she pointed at herself, ""me. My playing."" ""What a brilliant assessment,"" he commented sarcastically. What was wrong with this woman? Wasn""t she supposed to be happy? That her playing had sounded different because, well, she improved? Really, GenEd students really did not understand- ""I couldn""t feel it..."" Feel..? He stopped his train of thoughts as he looked at the female violinist still deep in contemplation. She was staring at the violin but not really seeing anything, her eyes lost, as if searching. ""When your mother played, it..."" her hands slowly traced a string, ""it.. it really felt so warm and peaceful and,"" she bit her lower lip as she searched for the right words, ""..and so much more."" Slowly, she raised her golden orbs to meet his. Unconsciously, he took a small step back, his eyebrows furrowed. Why was she looking at him as if she expected him to understand? She, of all people, should know that he didn""t-he didn""t, for goodness sake. He didn""t give a damn on what to feel as long as he played the notes perfectly, so how could he understand? ""I want others to feel it too, that warmth,"" she continued sadly as she lowered her eyes. ""I guess for a prodigy such as yourself, Tsukimori-kun, it must be really easy to deliver a moving performance.""",560480
1446,"Occasionally I would close my eyes and pray that sleep would overcome me like him, but it never did. It was hard getting to sleep nowadays wondering if you""d wake up the next morning. On top of the cancer, I was having to deal with the creepy ghosts that were haunting the house. Their activity had seemed to double tremendously over the course of the time. They""d harass me, scare me, and even reach out and touch me just to get me to squeal in fright. They were slowly driving me mad, and now I had no one to turn to, so as to find comfort. It was almost as if Matt had written me off at some point. The only comfort I ever found were in my dreams. In my dreams I was back home in Tennessee, back at the lake enjoying the breeze and the sun as it caressed my skin and hair. The blades of grass tickled against the skin that dared to touch it. The smell was intoxicating, as I would breathe in the smell of wild honeysuckle, but most of all my dreams consisted of him. For some odd reason I now felt comfort in Jonah""s presence. Something about him calmed me, and it helped a lot that he now came to me in human form, and not the charred self he was. He never talked, he always listened and touched. I was starting to fear that he had no voice, but then I reminded myself of the time he had spoken his name, and it brought comfort. Oh how I wish I could fall asleep soon so I could feel that comfort, but alas, I was stuck in the real world, fully awake in the basement with the one person who treated me as if I was a ghost like Jonah himself. Eventually I gave up trying to sleep and turned my head to continue reading the book I had bought earlier that day with Sara. It was the sequel to Evermore something called Blue Moon. To be honest it related way to much Twilight, except for the fact that it was about immortals not Vampires. Oh, and not to mention the ghost of the girl""s dead sister. How creepy would it be to have a ghost haunting you day in and day out? That""s right, I do have a ghost, or shall I say ghosts, haunting me day in, and day out. Sighing in exhaustion I sat the book down and turned off the light hoping that maybe now sleep would overcome me. As I lie there with my eyes closed I listened to the soft snores coming from across the room and the rain pattering against the house. It had started raining earlier that day and it hadn""t even started to let up by nightfall. Now the sounds of thunder could be heard, and the room lit up every few minutes as the lightning flashed, and yet Matt never stirred. I jumped as the thunder cracked loudly this time. It had sounded almost like a gunshot. I had to almost restrain myself from jumping out of bed and running to Matt. I refused to wake him from his peaceful sleep. Rarely did he get it. I continued to try and count sheep as the rain poured, and finally when I was almost able to slip into sleep the thunder cracked again making me jump in fright and squeal. I heard a chuckle from the other side of the room and immediately realized Matt had woken up.",806976
2366,"What about that, wasn""t that worth something to you? Your people turned you into this, dammit!"" I slumped forward onto the hard cracked concrete, my hands slapping against the pavement. My body was racked with sobs, ""I want..."" I balled my hands into fists again and my vision blurred completely as tears poured down my cheeks, wetting the broken stone. ""I want... I-I want my Francis back. Please..."" France knelt down in front of me and I looked up at him. He wiped my tears away with a small smile. It might have been my imagination but he looked regretful. Sad, almost. I shook my head and cried harder and the imperialist nation gathered me into his arms. I felt safe and secure, like when I was a little girl and he would hold me during a thunderstorm. ""Sesel..."" His voice was low as he leaned forward to whisper in my ear, ""You know I can""t go against the will of my people. Je n""ai pas le choix, ma chérie."" ""Fran-"" There was screams and I heard the distinct sound of something large and metallic plowing through many small flesh bodies. I came back to my senses and threw myself away from France. Three trucks skidded to a stop in front of me and a white-gloved hand shot out of the back. I grabbed it immediately and was hoisted into the truck, followed by Norway and the others. I was breathing heavily as the trucks took off and fell over. Exhaustion hit me like a ton of bricks. ""Seychelles?"" Iceland was by my side with Eritrea as my consciousness left me. Everything hit me all at once; all the pain, all the hurt. My head and wrist erupted in the pain I had been trying to ignore. The truck was spinning and there was ringing in my ears. They continued to call out for me but all I wanted to do was sleep. Just sleep and stay in my dreams of the past. Dreams of a little island. Dreams of how much fun we all used to have. Dreams of a blonde with ocean-blue eyes, the last thing I saw before letting the darkness take me. Author""s note: The part from the beginning is from the shipwrecked strip, where England and America are shipwrecked on an island that is later revealed to be Seychelles. France and Seychelles herself make an appearance in the strip too.

1128,"""M-merci, Adrien..."" Mari fidgeted in her seat as her best friend watched with a smirk. She dreamily watched him chat with Nino about the events of the modeling gig from yesterday. ""You totally wore that to look good for Adrien, didn""t you?"" Alya whispered conspiratorially. ""No!"" Mari whispered back. ""Just a little... But I did want to test it out. I really like the way the design of this skirt came out."" ""Hmm..."" her best friend wasn""t buying it. The rest of the day was full of compliments on her outfit, some from upperclassmen and others from the assistant art instructor Theo Barbeau. She was bubbling with happiness and euphoria, by the time math rolled around. Eli came late to school, but he had an excuse. He went to his seat in the back, near Nathanael. A few moments into class, Mari""s phone vibrated. She looked down to see it was a text from Eli. E: Like the outfit. The skirt would look better w/cardigan tho ;) Mari rolled her eyes and sent a quick reply. M: That""s a date look. This is a trip to the Brat""s Lair. Vest works for this. Mme. Mendeleiev chose that moment to reprimand Chloe for texting and Mari stealthily slipped her phone back into her bag. As Chloe argued that she was simply texting her driver to be ready after school. ""This is totally ridicule! Ridicule!"" Chloe pouted as Mendeleiev continued with her lesson, confiscating her phone. Adrien glanced over, not for the first time, at Mari as she gazed at Chloe""s room. It was pretty huge, fitting Mari""s room in it three times over. But I still prefer Mari""s room to this mausoleum, Adrien thought to himself, remembering the warmth of the Dupain-Cheng household. ""Mademoiselle Bourgeois, your snacks are here."" a maid said from the doorway. Chloe dismissed the older woman with a flick of her hand. ""Sabrina, bring the snacks over here. You are going to love this Eli-poo-"" Eli and the rest of the gang winced at the nickname. ""-I""ve got the best pastries in Paris. My chef is world-class."" Eli plucked a cream puff from the tray Sabrina wheeled in front of the quintet of friend and tossed it into his mouth without preamble. Adrien simply went with a fluffy looking croissant that was heavier than it looked. He tore off a piece and popped it in his mouth, only to find himself frowning. It tasted- ""Too sweet!"" Eli exclaimed, grabbing a napkin to spit it out into. ""Gross!"" ""It can""t be!"" Chloe gasped. ""Really?"" Alya and Mari picked a danish to share, after chewing it for a moment, forcibly swallowed the bites. ""It tastes like someone mixed too much sugar into this filling."" Alya grimaced. Given their danish was a cream cheese and strawberry one, the result would be disgusting. Mari had her fingers pressed to her lips and was staring at the pastry, hard. As a baker""s daughter, she was probably affronted. ""Well don""t trust you!"" Chloe picked up a cream puff and took a bite. ""Ew! This is disgusting!"" Chloe marched over to the phone and called down to the kitchen. Trepidation filled Adrien. He had a bad feeling Chat Noir was going to be necessary after this.",3439302

""I""ll make sure you get hurt in your next fight against someone Khaldun. I will never be yours and that is finally, even if it means having to runaway I will do so because it is better than being with you,"" Jamila whispered in an angry tone and then whirled around as her hair that was in braids slapped in his face and she walked away leaving an angry Khaldun but she then returned with a blush on her face and grabbed her mask and daggers and then walked out leaving a smirking Khaldun. -------End of Flashback--------- She knew these scenes were part of her life and that sometimes she didn""t really know what was happening in them but she assumed things about them. She put the daggers back in the box with the medallion and then put it back into the cabinet and closed it. She collapsed on the long wide seat she had and then turned around so she could lay down. She grabbed a pillow that was made of red silk and was given to the passengers as they got on the train and then given back to the train when they got off. She put the pillow behind her head and then laid her head on it and closed her eyes. Just as she was close to falling asleep there was a knock on her door and soon curses were flying from her mouth as in the kind where you cuss. She walked over to the door and flung it open to reveal a soldier. She looked him up and down not remembering seeing him before when Jabari introduced every damn soldier to her. She looked at him closer and noticed that he wasn""t even Egyptian really and looking even closer she found him not to even be a soldier. Before she knew it she was being kicked in the stomach, which reopened her wound from which she had got in the museum from saving the child. She got up shooting curse words from her mouth and then kicked him in the stomach as well sending him to the ground. She quickly opened the cabinet and grabbed the daggers out of the box. She swirled them around him her hands as her hair reddish brown hair laid strait around her face giving her an exotic look. (Okay if some of you have seen Elektra she looks a little like her only younger okay so there you go an outlook on Jamila.) The man stood up without any pain but his eyebrows lied because they showed from the way they looked, he was in pain. He turned around and tried to punch Jamila but she only dodged and rolled under his legs. She got on her back and kicked her foot into his butt sending him to the ground and she quickly got up and put her foot on his back keeping him from getting up. She said in a mumble, ""Let""s see who we are under this mask,"" as she took off his mask to find......... -------Anck-Su-Namun""s Pov.-------- Anck-Su-Namun sat with the child playing with her. They where playing with a puzzle trying to keep the child busy instead of crying for her mama.",806976
3010,"Yuuya shifted his attention to Rei, noticing the anger coursing through him. ""This is...this is outrageous..."" Rei was unmindful, mumbling incoherently. Yuuya grew worried, not seeing Rei this angry before. A knock was heard on the door. Yuuya stood up and answered it. Rei waited for the blonde to see whom it was, but was surprised when a throng of reporters came inside, Yuuya being dragged along. ""Tell us, Mr. Otohata, what do you think about this issue at hand?"" One female reporter asked. ""I think this is stupid..."" Rei answered lethargically. ""Are you worried about this? Is this another one of your stalkers?"" ""No...not in the least. Stalkers I can handle. It""ll be just like dealing with an overactive fan..."" Rei brushed the question off. ""Mr. Otohata, this was the first time an admirer came out and professed such emotions to you. What can you say about this?"" A teen reporter asked, cameras facing Rei for his answer. Rei gazed at the lenses of the weird machine. ""I don""t have time for this sort of nonsense, whoever you are. Just quit right now if you know what""s good for you."" He answered, a bit of irritation in his tone. The reporters crowded for more questions, had not Yuuya pushed them all out of the house and into the streets. Locking the door behind him, he sighed before returning to the table. ""Thanks Yuuya...I didn""t think I would be able to handle them a bit longer with their questions..."" Rei sighed on the table, massaging his temple. ""Rei...I don""t think we should go to school today."" Yuuya voiced out his concern, his eyes showing evident worry over the brunette. ""Nonsense..."" Rei answered, standing up to take his things from the chair. ""One thing the stalker would appreciate is finding me cooped up in my own house because I let him affect me. What""s important is that he shouldn""t feel I""m the least affected by what he""s doing..."" Yuuya smiled, nodding in agreement. Both left the house, the reporters trailing them behind like a pack of bloodhounds. School wasn""t as forgiving as it was back at Rei""s house. The students were more on the issue, frequently asking Rei what""s with what. Rei, being the typically quiet and type of person that says ""I""d rather be alone than stuck with people I don""t want to be with"", had his hands quite full. Yuuya, sensing Rei""s quiet consternation, managed all inquirers towards him, sparing Rei the pain and annoyance. While Yuuya was busy answering each and everyone""s questions, Akai quietly slid in the room and sat beside Rei, who spied him only a bit too late. Rei immediately grabbed him by the collar, dragging him to a secluded area of the room. Akai only grinned half-heartedly, amused by Rei""s behavior. ""What do you think you""re getting at?"" Rei hissed at him, perplexed by the young man in front of him. ""What went into your screw-loose head of making a big scene at downtown!"" Akai shrugged a bit, before answering Rei. ""Chill, Rei. It""s to remove any suspicions why a few ""accidents"" would be falling your way a few days from now.",583064
1476,"""But I""m not sure if it""s a good idea - Hikaru is,"" he hesitated, trying to find a polite word to describe him, ""rambunctious."" ""Many Go players have their own little peccadilloes,"" his mother said. ""I""m sure it will be fine. Next Saturday would work out very well - if you want, I can call his parents to make arrangements."" Akira shut his eyes, taking a deep breath to remain calm. It wasn""t worth pointing out that he was fifteen years old; his mother had made up her mind, and wouldn""t be stopped until she got her way. Her quietly implacable personality was like a force of nature. ""I""m sure that won""t be necessary,"" he replied instead. ""Good,"" his father said, releasing a braying laugh. ""I""ve been meaning to ask your brat of a friend a couple of questions."" ""Please don""t. I want him to stay my friend."" Akira wasn""t above begging when it came to mitigating his father""s pushy tendencies. His mother set a hand on Akira""s shoulder reassuringly. ""We won""t embarrass you, Akira,"" she promised, before casting a stern look at her husband. ""Right?"" His father scowled, but knew better than to argue. ""Yes, dear,"" he agreed, but his face drew itself into an unhappy frown. ""Is dinner going to be ready soon?"" ""Another hour, which should give you time to finish with your cigar and answer some of your fan mail,"" was the response. Akira could only shake his head at his parents, amazed as always at his mother""s firm control of their marriage. His father may have been the Honinbou and most respected person in the entire Japanese Go world, but none of that mattered when Kuwabara Kouko made up her mind about how things needed to be. During dinner, his father pontificated on the state of Go world, lamenting the lack of upcoming talent with the notable exception of his son. Akira, who had heard the spiel many, many times before, tuned him out through long practice, instead letting his mind wander to his plans for later in the evening. While Akira wasn""t sure he wanted to continue to pursue professional Go for the rest of his life, he loved the game more than anything else in the world. He knew that two of the best net Go players would be meeting on line tonight, and he fully intended to watch the entire game, no matter how late it kept him up. After finishing his homework - he needed to ensure his grades were good in case he decided to attend college - Akira turned his computer on and logged onto The Internet Go Server to witness the match. SAI was already on line, he noted, but his opponent hadn""t shown yet. Akira listened carefully, waiting for the unmistakable light-tread of his mother ascending the stairs. After the door to his mother""s sewing room shut, he smiled knowingly. Less than a minute later, the renowned net Go player KOUYO appeared. As the game opened between the two most famous Net Go players, Akira wished he had the courage to walk over to his mother""s room to watch her play. But she had never told anyone that she played Net Go, and it was her secret to keep.",1112924
2684,"Hisako seemed to giggle to herself again, puzzling Matsushita and making Fujimaki frown in annoyance. She shook her head back and forth before answering the judo expert. ""I don""t know what you""ve been told, but expensive gifts are definitely not the way to go. She""d probably just get insulted if you got her something like that..."" Hisako rubbed her chin as she began to think to herself. As the others waited for her answer, Fujimaki just seemed to be trying to ignore her. Every time the fight-holic looked at Hisako, he always felt his heart skip a beat. He hated the feeling, and he could never let anyone know about that. It would ruin his reputation forever. ""Rock, dust, light, star?"" TK asked, but as usual, his answer made no sense to Hisako. Her mind was already made up however. She gave Matsushita a very sly smile before leaning on the table right next to Fujimaki, aggravating him even more. ""I think I""ll let you figure it out. If you really are the right guy for my best friend, then you can succeed without my help. I don""t know how""s he going to help you though."" Hisako said, referring to TK. The dancer almost seemed insulted at first, but he shook it off and responded with one of his usual catch-phrases. ""Kiss you!"" Matushita looked down at his desk, realizing the challenge before him. And TK""s phrases weren""t really making any sense to him now, so how would this guy""s advice help him before break was done? The judo expert sighed, his voice sounding suddenly dry. ""I hope you""ve got something good planned, TK..."" TK snapped his fingers and spun up from his chair. ""It""s my turn! C""mon let""s dance!"" T.K Break had always been one of Iwasawa""s favorite times of the day. It was a little strange. She enjoyed creating music more than listening to it, but she still couldn""t help but cherish anytime she could get the chance to just listen to music that someone else was playing. And the break between classes, where most people would eat lunch and hang our with their friends, was the time when she sat in the club room and listened to her music. And so naturally, Iwasawa did not hear the sound of someone knocking on the clubroom door. TK continued to knock on the door repeatedly as Matsushita waited anxiously. Nevertheless, the judo expert felt extremely nervous right now, so he hoped TK would be able to do most of the work for him. At the same time, he cursed himself for being so weak. ""Knocking on heaven""s door!"" TK shouted from the outside of the clubroom door in his loudest voice. Iwasawa was too absorbed with her music to hear him, and he could only groan to himself as he discovered the door was locked. ""Maybe this isn""t the best time."" Matsushita commented. He was beginning to think this was all turning into a really bad idea. TK looked at him with a serious face. It was a face that pretty much told the judo expert... ""There""s no giving up now."" And so, Matsushita said nothing, and TK continued to knock on the door like a maniac.",967934
2355,"Once finished he stood upright and began to leave. Then, he halted. ""And just so you know; I love Pucca. But to me, she""s a little sister- a precious one. I like ""em sassy."" With that, Hue was back in the sea of partying. Garu made his decision and dove into the crush again. He didn""t need Hue to tell him what he already knew. Pucca was a bit nervous to go on stage. Not that she had stage freight; but these were her friends and family. And she was going away for a long time. Suddenly, someone grabbed her arm and twisted her around. Just as she was going to counter it, lips smashed down on hers. She giggled with glee. She""d know those lips anywhere. ""Garu!"" she whispered. ""I...I won""t talk until you come back. I""m taking a vow of silence until your back. And then- And then, I have something to tell you."" Pucca""s heart softened into mush as she was pulled back by Kim. ""You""re on, superstar."" The music cut and everyone stopped dancing as Pucca took the mike. ""Hey, everyone! Are you having a good time?"" The cheers assailed her ears like the Sooga Olympic team had taken gold. ""Well, now on a serious note... I""m leaving Sooga Village."" ""What?!"" ""Why?!"" ""Dada- did you know about this?!"" Pucca waited until they calmed- and when that became impossible, she nodded to Xavier who struck a loud cord from his guitar into the mike. ""Thank you. I""m going to Hollywood, to star in Director Quang""s movie called Sentient 1NE. Look for it in the theaters. Its a seven-month gig, and I""ll be back soon. Check my NinjaBook while I""m gone. And now Kim with an update."" Bags in the truck, seven-hundred goodbyes said, and one promise of an invite to the premier later, Pucca was on a private jet heading for stardom. Garu sat on the Goh-Rong steps and sighed raggedly. Abyo and Ching passed by, only to find out that he was in a vow of silence. Garu frowned at the disappearing streak in the sky. He wanted her back; so badly. And now, not even Tobey""s attacks could distract him. Abyo had jokingly said, ""You""re so gone, dude."" And then proceeded to begin ripping off his Kung-Fu shirt, only to have Ching skip by with Won on her head. Garu sighed again. He was gone; or at least his heart was... AnimeKitty: Ask me no questions, I give you no barbecue sauce. Pucca is in Hollywood. Garu is far gone, and who cares about Tobey. Review, please Funny Love Pucca stepped off the plane and onto Sooga. Immediately, she was swarmed by her friends and family. ""Pucca,"" Ching cried, wrapping her best friend in a bear hug lethal to all humans. Pucca smiled through the pain, knowing Ching was partially trying to keep her here. ""I missed you Ching. I missed all of you. Hollywood is sooo cutthroat- its always ""say this, do that, put more passion into that scene""! Luckily I wasn""t in the cast of Jersey Shore."" ""Did you meet Channing Tatum?"" ""Is Rhianna""s hair really cherry red up close?"" ""Can Jackie Chan really karate kick sausages into submission?"" Answering them all in order she replied, ""Yeah, he plays the alien sentinal who turns good. Her hair is actually not that red up close.",3439302
1885,"""I know,"" said Michelle. She leaned back once more, carefully, as Tony""s hand was still on her shoulder. He slightly bent above her and put the other hand on her other shoulder. His fingers began gently to massage her tensed muscles. Michelle seemed bewildered, but only for a moment. Then she heaved a deep sigh and closed her eyes, leaning back into the chair and giving herself over to the careful, almost tender touch of his hands. Tony worked his way up to her neck and then put his hands to her temples, where he continued those smooth circular moves. He was meanwhile standing so close behind her that Michelle""s head was slightly leaning against his chest. He almost closed his eyes as well. This closeness was so consoling, so warm, so right... He completely forgot time. All that counted was being here with Michelle, proving her that he cared. If you only knew how much I wish to just take you in my arms and not let go. If you only knew how desperately I want this endless day to be over. Michelle""s eyes were still closed, and Tony could feel her starting to relax under his touch. The tension left her body, and she was breathing evenly. He bent her head slightly back in order to get better to her temples. Her head was now resting against his chest, and he felt a slight shudder run down his spine. It was not so much the fact that she was so close, but rather the strong feeling that this seemed so right and normal to him. As if he had done it a thousand times before and would never tire to do it again. And Michelle""s complete relaxation gave evidence of how deeply she trusted him. Tony knew from his own experience that it took a while until you were able to give yourself over to another person like that. His moves were gradually slowing down until his hands just lay still against her head. He hated to tell her to go back to work, but there was no other way. ""Michelle,"" he said softly and bent deeper over her. ""I""m sorry, now you really have to go back to work. We can""t afford a thirty-minute-break."" Michelle opened her eyes. Tony could see that she had to make a tremendous effort to do so. Since he was still bent over her and her head still lay back against his chest, their eyes locked once again. Tony wanted to avert his eyes, but this time he couldn""t. Instead his hands slid down her face, his thumbs gently stroking her cheeks. The sudden urge - no, need - to show her some tenderness became overwhelming, and Tony conceded. ""Michelle, please hold on,"" he whispered, bending deeper over her. ""I know it""s a terrible day for us all, but please be strong. I""ll be, too. Let us both be strong and find out how we can stop this war. For President Palmer, for Jack, and for those who died - George, Paula, Yusuf... I know we can make it."" While speaking, Tony bent even further and brought his own face close to hers. ""Michelle, I know we have a lot to talk about,"" he whispered. ""And I promise you, when all of this is over, we will talk - that is, if you want to at all. But for the moment I can""t do anything but this.""",240213
152,"""I-I mean-"" the room was silent and it intensified the awkwardness, at least for Kahoko""s part. Her cheeks grew hot, ""I-I mean."" ""My father likes that kind of violin,"" he answered nonchalantly, and Kahoko wondered if he hadn""t felt her awkwardness or he really was just too unfeeling to notice. ""Oh, really?"" she laughed nervously. ""I-I guess this must have been his then."" She scratched her head apologetically, ""I thought this was yours, I mean, it""s the same color and yet, I knew of course that you would never let me use your violin even if it""s a matter of life and death. I mean, your violin might hate me if I played it, I""m too terrible at playing after all,"" she ranted amidst her nervous laughter. ""Yeah,"" he replied quietly, his light blue hair obscuring his eyes. ""Now, why don""t you try playing?"" Tsukimori was right. The problem was in the violin. Kahoko opened her eyes as she finished playing Gavotte. She could almost hear her heart beating fast. It had been a while since she felt so moved while playing. Her mind drifted back to the days when her violin still contained its magic. Now-she looked at the violin still positioned on her shoulder- it almost felt the same as before. As if, this was a magical violin too.. Tsukimori seemed satisfied by her performance that he merely nodded. He was about to say something, when the door opened. Hamai Misa strode inside the room and noticed the two violinists. ""Oh, Len dear, I""m sorry,"" she apologized but the mischievous glint on her blue eyes did not escape him. ""I thought you were practicing in your room."" ""Mother,"" he said calmly. ""I informed you yesterday that we are going to use this music room."" ""Oh,"" Hamai Misa thought for a while. ""I forgot,"" she then turned to Kahoko and smiled brightly, ""Hello Hino Kahoko dear."" Kahoko quickly bowed. ""Hello miss Hamai Misa, I-I""m really sorry to be of trouble."" The older woman shook her head. ""You are no trouble dear, you are very much welcome in his house,"" she gave Len a quick look that implied something Len didn""t want to even think about. ""Please continue your practice, I""ll bring up some delicious snack later."" ""Thank you, so much, miss Hamai Misa."" ""Oh dear, just call me miss Misa,"" she waved her hand and was about to exit the room when she caught sight of the violin Kahoko was holding. She looked at it for a while before smiling at the red-haired violinist. ""You like golden violins, Kahoko dear?"" ""Oh,"" she also looked at the violin and nodded. ""It""s pretty, isn""t it? Your husband really does have a good taste in violin, miss Misa."" ""Mother, don""t you have something to do?"" Tsukimori cut her mother before she could say anything. Too late, Tsukimori thought as his mother smiled at him knowingly, figuring everything. He sighed and massaged his temples. ""Don""t push yourself too hard, Kahoko dear, and Len dear, don""t be too harsh on her,"" his mother exited the door still smiling and closed the door behind her. Hamai Misa stared at the closed door for a while before proceeding downstairs to ready the snacks. She sighed. Oh Len dear, you""ve really grown up.",560480
3016,"""We only took your clothes off because the heat might have gone to your head."" Musica emphasized, pointing at his cranium. ""Sou ka...I was hallucinating then...Ahh...gomen nasai..."" Haru bowed, blushing furiously at both of them. It must have been pretty insulting for both of them that Haru was insinuating that they were homo or something. ""Ah, forget it. I brought you your dinner, Gale is also taking his food at his own room."" Shuda brought in a tray of food. ""Anou...Shuda-san...did Gale and I...quarrel or something?"" Haru peeked from his spikes of hair. ""Uhm..."" Shuda was trying to ignore Haru""s question, until Musica cut in. ""I""m sure you didn""t mean to hurt him or something, Haru-kun."" Musica looked away."" But based on what Shuda-san had said to me, he must have been hit really bad by what you said to him earlier..."" ""That""s just me...I always manage to screw up everything..."" Musica and Shuda looked up to Haru, who was conveniently hiding his eyes beneath his hair again, tears slowly flowing in his cheeks. ""Anou...Haru-kun..."" Musica tried to reach to him, until Shuda took his arm. ""Haru, you""re here in Japan now. Whatever your past was cannot reach you here. Try to live a life different from what you hated or liked. Be the person you wish to be in here. We""re here to understand you, don""t you forget that."" Shuda slowly stood up, dragging the reluctant Musica from his bed. ""Eat your dinner, and just leave the tray by the side of the bed. I""ll come by to pick it up later. Oyasumi, Haru-kun..."" Shuda gently eased the door shut. ""Shuda-san..."" Haru raised his head, Shuda waiting to here what he wanted to say. ""Arigato...soshite oyasumi nasai..."" Shuda gave a gentle nod as he finally closed the door. Haru took a few bites of food, yet had lost his appetite. He knew...that his nightmare will haunt him again... Whatever your past was cannot reach you here. Try to live a life different from what you hated or liked. Be the person you wish to be in here. We""re here to understand you, don""t you forget that. Haru eased a gentle smile at what Shuda had said. It gave him comfort to sleep peacefully that night. Oyasumi... Meep! Chapter 2 is done! And I wanted to clarify things here, since all in all they are in Japan, I was gonna add some vocabulary. Not to get confused, here are the words I used in here. And they say you don""t learn anything from reading fan fiction! Hah! Konnichiwa - a standard greeting but literally means ""good afternoon"". It can be used at anytime of the day. Moosiwake arimasen - not commonly heard but literally means ""forgive me"". The more casual term would be gomen nasai or simply gomen. Irrashaimase - ""welcome"" Gaijin - the other term for ""foreigner"" Atashi kara Gallage Island desu, soshite, ore wa... - ""I""m from Gallage Island, and, I am..."" Sou desu ka - ""Is that so"" Otukaresama desita - ""You must be tired"" -kun - a term used by males to establish familiarity. Sichuree shimashita - ""Excuse me [for what I did/said]"" Maa...maa - ""relax"" Honto ka? Yokatta desu ne! - ""Are you sure? That""s great/wonderful!""",583064
776,"""Good just a little headache but that was just because of that damn drink I had last night. I think I might go to the motor cross track today and then swing by the store and pick up some groceries because we are out,"" Dawn said a she quickly chugged down her milk and then sitting it down on the coffee table. She leaned on Dominic""s shoulder as she watched T.V. ""You know I think I got one more level on this damn thing and I""ll be done and maybe I can come with you because I don""t trust you when you buy food,"" Tej said as he pushed the buttons on his game boy. Dawn stuck her tongue out at him and flipped him off. ""What about you Dominic what is your plans for the day,"" Dawn asked smiling up at him. ""I have to work on the car that way it will be ready for the next race. Oh by the way please take my bike that way you won""t have a wreck on that piece of junk you call a motor cross bike,"" Dominic said. Dawn just grumbled under her breath as she got up and went to get dressed. She put her hair up as usual to keep it off of her neck. She also put on her tight hip hugger jeans that looked all torn up and worn out. She walked over to her closet and picked out her shirt that looked torn up but was jut made like that and had the saying on it that said, ""Don""t Make Me Mad,' in red. She put on her black bra so that it will show threw her white shirt. She liked making boys drool over her. She grabbed her black shoes and slipped into them. She then grabbed her keys to her other car and her CD case. She walked out of her room to find Tej was also ready to go and walked out with her where she found Dominic loading his bike into her truck. She smiled at him for that. She got into the car and turned it on waiting for Tej to get in. She put in her ""Eminem Curtain Call the hits,' She then turned it to number 14 which was the song ""When I""m Gone,' by Eminem. Dominic walked up and handed Dawn""s gear through the window. ""Please don""t get into trouble or hurt or your brother is going to kill me,"" Dominic said. ""I won""t you know me,"" Dawn said. ""That""s what I""m afraid of because I know you,"" Dominic said looking down as he leaned on the car. About that time Tej got in after loading in his bike and gear. ""Well are we going or are you to lovers going to talk all day,"" Tej said. ""We""re not lovers,"" Dawn and Dominic said at the same time. ""By the way one of the Fantastic four will be at the races today so be careful,"" Dominic said. ""Alright,"" Dawn said and started up the car and then put it in reverse and began to back up out of the drive and then when she was on the road put it in forward again and drove off toward the bike races. Anything that had a motor she usually knew how to drive and she was determined to go down knowing she had a wild life. She drove past all of the large buildings in the city. She drove past the place where her car had crashed and saw that it was gone but there were pieces still left there like little shinning pieces of glass. She grimaced at that and then remembered that her car crashed because of that Invisible girl.",806976
463,"Thoughts of the Captain naturally took a down turn and she envisioned his developed neck muscles. Unconsciously, Seras began to slowly imagine him from the neck and down. First came his thick, veined neck. Following that were his immensely broad shoulders; muscled beyond a girl""s wildest dreams and too wide for most door frames. She couldn""t get her arms around him in a hug since he was so big, but he could easily fit his vast arms around her. When he did, she felt warm and safe in the harbour that his brawny body provided. Feelings of lust were briefly overtaken by romantic overtones. She didn""t know what life had to offer; she was just living day by day, hoping that it all would end somehow. With all her heart, she sincerely hoped that the Captain would be in her future. As she signed document after document and typed madly on a computer, her mind wandered back to the Captain""s sizeable manhood. Her lip turned up in a bit of a smile as she thought of that golden treasure of masculinity that the Captain was born with. At first it didn""t fit; which wasn""t wholly sad since the Captain could pleasure with his tongue better than any lesbian. Sometimes when he licked her treasure area, Seras swore that the Captain could tie knots and fold origami with is tongue. More than once he""d sent her into screaming oblivion by his tongue and lips alone. Seras shivered at her desk but kept working; that didn""t stop her from continuing to dream about the oh so manly Captain. He""d already taught her so much about pleasure; how to give it as well as to receive it. It wasn""t exactly easy for her, being a virgin girl on the D-11 police force. Despite her reputation for toughness; the sexism and crudeness of the men frequently left her blushing and stumbling for words. Now though, she could deep throat with the best of them. After downing what the Captain had to offer, swallowing any other man""s meat would seem not only easy, but laughable. He always warned her when he was about to erupt, which was far more courtesy than most men allowed the girls they had. Seras"" handwriting was becoming messier as larger parts of her brain were used to process the amazing awesomeness that was the Captain. She remembered taking his manhood into her body for the first time. It was huge and he had to let it partly deflate before fully pushing into her, but it was worth it. Naturally, she""d had hours of preparation in order to accommodate a member of his girth, but it was worth it. On any other man, such a member would have seemed terrifying but on the captain it was beautiful and magnificent; a collector""s item that any women would want to get her hands on. Seras had finally stopped writing and was now writhing in her seat and rubbing her thighs together. Her coffee brake was almost here, it would be wise of her to get out of here before she started dripping below the waist. Her pleasant sexy daydreams were interrupted when somebody rapped a high heeled shoe on her desk, startling Seras and causing her to help. Curses upon curses; it was Tedora the Underage here to pay a visit.",1220273
3418,"Weird as that may seem, the two teens were completely comfortable with this process. Joe""s closet was endlessly entertaining for Alice, who had taken home much of the junk to renew, retouch, and sell at the local pawn shop. ""Joe, your closet is like an antique store,"" she remarked, peering at an old Monopoly game. She carefully set it aside with things she was going to keep. ""Yeah..."" he muttered absently. Huh, this doesn""t look green enough. Maybe if I just put a little more on his chest... Joe went to dip the brush in the green pot, and in the process, the phone rang. Joe jumped, upsetting the pot and causing it to spill its contents all over the newspaper. ""Shit."" He carefully removed the pot from the green ooze now spreading across the paper, chiding himself for not being more careful- model paint was expensive. He was about to throw it away when Deputy Lamb opened the door. ""It""s for you,"" he held out the phone to his son. ""Yeah, thanks... hello?"" Joe held the phone in between his ear and shoulder. ""Is Cary on drugs?"" Charles asked him. ""Pardon?"" Charles repeated his request. ""Uh, not that I know of, no,"" Joe replied, sitting at his desk again. He took up the paintbrush again as he asked, ""Is that why you called? Because you just made me waste good paint, and-"" ""Dude, he turned down the Star Wars festival!"" Joe nearly made a blot of red on Frankenstein""s nose. ""What?"" ""He turned down Star Wars! I called him just now, you know, to ask if he wanted to go- and he said he had to do his homework!"" Joe was in shock. ""Wow,"" was all he could say. ""And then, you know what he said next?"" ""Tell me, tell me, tell me, pleaseeee..."" ""He said Elle was going to come over and help him with it!"" ""Oh my God..."" ""Dude! He turned down Star Wars for a girl!"" Charles was shouting so loud that Joe had to hold the phone at arm""s length. ""Okay, Charles, calm down.. deep breaths, deep breaths..."" ""What happened?"" Alice asked from the depths of his closet. ""Cary turned down the Star Wars festival for Elle!"" ""What?"" Alice reappeared in the doorway, mouth hanging open. ""I know!"" ""Joe, I just needa ask you one question,"" Charles said. ""Shoot."" ""Is it possible that Cary is falling in love for the first time?"" Oooh, Cary... ;) NERD ALERT!~ Yes. I am obsessed with Star Wars. Contrary to what I""ve written, I would NEVER pass up the opportunity to go to a festival for it just for ""homework""... DUDES! I""m losing my voice D: I hope I don""t have strep throat or anything because that would suck... last time I lost my voice I was like five and I had to sign language to my dad to get me Cheerios... ""No."" ""Yes."" ""No!"" ""Yes!"" Third period art class was proving very difficult for Joe. For one, he couldn""t convince Cary to go after Elle. And for another, his clay pot wasn""t coming out too hot. As much as he tried, he couldn""t get his pot to thicken enough without flopping all over the place. Cary wasn""t doing much better, either. It didn""t help that Alice, who was sitting to Joe""s left, was halfway done... and of course it was perfect. ""Come on!",2855986
1025,"Gale, somehow taken off guard, shivered a bit from surprise. ""I...there are so many things I wanted to talk about you and your family, Haru...I just don""t know where to start..."" ""One at a time, Gale...we have all the time to do so..."" Gale heaved a sigh and carefully solicited answers from the platinum blonde. Haru, in the other, answered each and every question with assertion, answers that could both satisfy them. It was a long afternoon to begin with...and a long night to end... Haru had spoken first. ""In truth, Gale...father was very much a compassionate man. He was one to help anyone whom he found needed it. Of course, he coupled it along with his sense of justice..."" Haru spoke short, somehow pained each time he answered one of Gale""s questions. To bring up something you may or may not have momentarily lost was like continuously stabbing your heart with a needle. Gale smiled a bit, satisfied at being sated of his curiosity. How he admired Haru""s kindness. A few days ago, he was acting like a jerk in front of him...now, everything just seemed so, so different. ""Gale..."" ""Yes, Haru?"" ""Tell me...how many years has it been since you...lost your parents?"" ""...close to twelve years now. I was four years old back then. My father, he died in a firefight that involved the police...my mother was accidentally shot. I was left all alone, and I hid amongst the rubble that was once our home. I saw your father, he looked like he was looking for something. I had always thought he was the one responsible for their death."" ""I was found later on, and was brought to a local orphanage. The nuns were kind in there. They taught me the basics of school and...all that I would need when I""d grow up. A year later, your father found me. I was angry at him...no, make that furious. He said he""d take me in under his care. I was resistant at first, but the nuns believed him, and handed in my papers."" ""My first trip out of the orphanage was to prison. There, he showed me the man who was responsible for killing my parents. I was needless to say, shocked, after realizing the truth. It was then, that I felt very foolish for accusing your father a deed he never had done. All the anger I kept inside seemed to have gone to waste...but I didn""t think it was all for nothing. What anger had left void in my soul was quickly replaced by love."" ""He told me that I had to study, and I was surprised very much when he showed me a dorm, in my elementary years. He gave me all that I needed, and for gratitude towards him, I studied very well just to make him proud. He was happy for me, and I, for myself also. He acted very much like my father...a bit of a dolt, an idiot to say the least and also childish. But he had character, and he knew how to use it for all its worth."" ""Your mother, Aunt Sakura, she was kindly in all the same. She complemented your father very much. She was reasonable, levelheaded, stately and mature. She also made the best chocolate chip cookies I could find. She was just like my mother..."" ""Sister Cattleya was just like a younger version of Auntie Sakura.",583064
1743,"France""s eyes grew cold and distant as he let go of me and turned to the others. Japan sheathed his sword and gave a slight bow of respect, ""We have gathered up most of the African nations that took refuge here, Bonnefoy-san."" ""How many? Which ones?"" Why did they call him that? He wasn""t my Francis anymore. ""Seven,"" Greece answered from next to Japan, ""Ghana, Niger, Eritrea, Mauritania, Chad, Sudan, and Uganda. The soldiers have rounded them all up and are awaiting your orders."" ""Take them back to Paris,"" France ordered, ""See if we can get any of them to join us willingly. The others will need to be... persuaded."" My eyes widened as the two saluted him and the three left, France ordering the others to take me to the rest of them. This wasn""t France; this wasn""t the man I knew. I wanted him back so much... so much it hurt. I wanted everything to go back to the way it was. Swimming with France, bickering with England, watching anime with Japan, Germany, and Italy. I wanted it all back. I wanted him back. But there was no going back. He was gone. Francis Bonnefoy was dead; the French Empire killed him. ""Get up,"" One of the men lifted me up roughly. Pain erupted in my arm with his vice grip on my bandages. All that would come out was a weak whimper. They led me from the room and through the crumbling, dark walls to outside. It was dark now and in the center of the tiny huts in this shadow of a town were my comrades. ""Uganda!"" I yelled out. The man who held me gripped my arm tighter and I yelped. He threw me towards the others and the dark-skinned African nation caught me when I stumbled. Uganda straightened me up and smiled weakly. A metallic glint told me he was handcuffed, and a quick sweep of the others revealed them all to be as well. Not only handcuffed but shackled; chained like animals waiting to escape. Which was true. We were animals now. Hunted and fighting to survive. I jumped when someone tapped my shoulder and swerved around to have a soldier clamp the same handcuffs on me. ""You the island Seychelles?"" Another soldier next to him asked. I nodded numbly, my entire body screaming at me to run. I wanted away from here, I wanted out of this horrid place. The soldiers walked in front of me and thrust his arms behind my neck. I jumped and squeezed my eyes shut, the feeling of something metallic being snapped around my neck. When he was done I opened my eyes and reached up to touch it. I paled. A collar. A colonies collar. It was like the collar England had made me wear back at the Academy but all silvery metal and more like a choker. My body felt icy as I fingered the ornately carved fleur de lis at it""s center. ""SeySey..."" I looked down to see the little Eritrea tugging at my torn dress. She didn""t have a collar. Neither did any of the others... what did that mean? ""What""s wrong Eri?"" I knelt down and ruffled her long scraggly hair. She wore a dress that was once white but now had the color of the sick tuna back home. Home... ""Where are we going?"" Her voice was so childlike and so innocent it made me want to cry all over again.",748687
816,"""Well,"" Tea explained, ""I got bored, and decided I""d surprise. Are you surprised?"" ""Very,"" Yami said through gritted teeth and an overly wide smile. ""Love me?"" Tea asked in a sugery voice. ""Love you,"" Yami replied. ""Well, it""s been a long day, shouldn""t turn it?"" ""Oh, but I just got here,"" Tea said. ""Would you get my things, dear?"" ""Of course,"" Yami said, he went around the back of the car to retrieve the luggage and tip the driver. With this chance too good to pass up, Joegore clapped his hands, and said, ""Darlin!"" He shuffled over to Tea and laid his head on her bountiful chest as he asked, ""How you doin"" ?"" ""Uh.. I..."" Tea stuttered, wondering how she could escape from this grotesque minion. ""Love me?"" Joegore asked in a mocking sugery voice. ""I... uh... I just met you,"" Tea reasoned. Just then, however, Yami came back around. ""Let""s just keep this between you and me,"" he said rolling his crossed eyes around. ""Certainly,"" Tea said as Yami stood in front of them. ""Joegore, take care of these,"" Yami said, throwing the suitcases at Joegore, who failed to catch them and went sprawling on the ground, covered by a mountain of brand name leather luggage. ""Yes master,"" the hunchback grunted from under the Italian bag. ""My dear, this is our housekeeper, Kikyo,"" Yami said. Lightening flashed, thunder clapped, horses reared, and Serenity screamed. ""And this excitable young lady is my lab assistant, Serenity."" ""You""re his assistant?"" Tea asked, eyeing Serenity suspiciously. ""Oh, I""m more than just his assistant,"" Serenity said, flaunting her womanly charms. ""I""m his lover."" ""His WHAT!?!"" Tea exclaimed. Behind her, Yami had been waving his arms around wildly to shut Serenity up- but it hadn""t worked- but Tea swung around and grabbed Yami by his scrawny neck . ""FIVE YEARS!!"" she screamed. ""Five years of my life I waste on you! Giving you devotion! I saved myself for you! And when I leave you alone for a week, and you hop in bed with the village IDIOT!?!?!"" ""I""m not the village idiot,"" Serenity said proudly, ""I""m the village whore. My brother""s the village idiot."" Joegore wiggled his ears and eyebrows, still thinking he had a shot. Tea huffed and dropped her choking fiancé, and said, ""That does it! I""m going home to mother, and I""m keeping the rock!"" She croed, getting back into the car. ""Wait, Tea, don""t go,"" Yami begged. He drooped to his knees, and said, ""I haven""t finished paying the deposit on that ring."" ""Tough luck!"" Tea shouted. She slammed the door on the cab, and the car tore out of there at 98 miles an hour. Yami sighed as he got up on his feet again, and turned around and looked at Serenity, who was smiling cheerfully. ""Why did you have to do that?"" Yami asked her. ""She was loaded. I could have retired in a year with her father""s money."" ""Because I want you all to myself,"" Serenity said. ""What can she offer you that I can""t?"" ""Well, for one thing, she had a huge set of melons,"" Yami said. ""And like mine aren""t?"" Serenity said opening her robe. Yami;""s eyes widened, and Joegore covered his eyes. ""Whoa, sis!""",512464
1237,"Was Athrun playing some trick? What is he planning? What did he mean? Athrun smiled and handed his umbrella to the lady. ""You""ll shiver to death if you stay here any longer."" ""Hey! you didn""t answer me!"" Cagalli was still Cagalli and she had the quickest temper on Earth... or even at the PLANTs. ""You don""t need to go back,"" Athrun explained as he tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear. ""Where do you really want to go, Cagalli?"" It was faint, but definitely it was a blush. It had been a while since Cagalli blushed and, as much as she hated it, her feelings for a certain blue-haired coordinator were creeping back to her. She didn""t know what to make out of his simple words... his gestures, they were gentle. There was no pressure in his words. He was letting her decide. It scared her. She knew that about half an hour ago, she made a decision that definitely placed Orb in an unstable situation. She didn""t want to repeat the same mistake. There was a little voice in her head that wanted her to be free. But her rational mind wouldn""t allow it. She knew that what she""ll do is running away. And right now, running wasn""t an option. ""Anywhere, Cagalli, I""ll accompany you,"" Athrun suddenly added. Cagalli could feel water dropping down her cheeks but she wasn""t the type to admit they were tears. It didn""t matter anyway, for the bliss she felt was numbing. It was Athrun""s reassuring smile. He was smiling at her just like how he smiled when he left her. But it was different this time. ""Athrun...!"" Nothing mattered to her as she flung her arms around his waist, her fragile form crashing into his arms as she seek for sanctuary. It was one of those instances when she allowed herself to cry. The salty tears mingled with dirt and rainwater all trailed down her cheek then down his shirt. The umbrella he was holding fell off his grasp. She caught him off guard. To her surprise, she felt his palm rubbed her back as if soothing her. There was silence as they stayed at that position for the longest time. It didn""t matter anymore if Athrun lost his memories. It didn""t matter if it is running away. It didn""t matter if they were only friends. Maybe... even just for a day... she could forget all these things. s s It was the sound of crashing waves that reminded Cagalli of him. Whenever she thought about it, the sounds brought melancholy unto her. This is the reason why she hated coming to the beach. There were just so many memories that the innocent place reminded her. But now, she found herself standing in a beach. It was again one of her mind""s indestructible ideas. Somehow, she wanted herself to be reminded of all the times she shared with Athrun. It lingered in her mind but she pushed it away. Will it hurt to remember all those things especially with Athrun by her side? It was a question she tried to ask herself during their trip but the answer wouldn""t just pop up. The sight that was presented before took her breath away. The majestic sun hovered just above the horizon, throwing an orange-with-red-and-yellow hue all over the sky.",560480
1056,"Kaji and Ayu quickly pulled Tsujiai, Mikami-sensei and Mito into the nearest curtain to hide. ""Ladies and gentlemen! You are very lucky to witness the making of a very rare potion!"" The lady announced. The people just kept silent. ""Isn""t that Luna?"" Tsujiai whispered. Ayu nodded. ""Then, why are we hiding?"" Mikami-sensei asked. ""Oh yeah, right."" Kaji scratched his head and they all emerged from their hiding place. ""This potion is called ""The summoning potion"". With this, you could summon the spirits of the dead."" Luna continued. The people""s eyes widened in fear. The potion was definitely in the black list. ""And it would be demonstrated by, none other than, Orihara Maya."" Luna finished. Silence ruled over them as Maya entered the room. Traces of hidden excitement could be found on her features. Tsujiai, Kaji, Mikami-sensei, Ayu and Mito gasped. If Maya is here, then Yuta must also be here. Mito""s eyes widened. She remembered what Luna said about Yuta being an ingredient in a potion. Could it be that... Yuta is already in that cauldron? She fainted. ""Mito-chan!"" Mikami-sensei caught her as she fell. Luna looked over at their direction. ""What can you say about this dream? Isn""t it nice?"" Luna asked. Maya looked at her disbelievingly. ""You mean..."" She started. Luna nodded. ""What do you mean?"" A voice interrupted them. It was the prince. Behind him were Rio and Tama. Luna immediately made her way to the prince and gave him a flower. ""I gave it to him!!!"" Luna squealed. The others sweat dropped. ""Anyway, what the heck happened here?"" Rio asked. He looked at Nina who was still beating the guy then at Maya who was standing in front of the cauldron. ""Why don""t we ask them?"" Tama pointed Luna and Maya. ""You see, I placed some potion on your goblets on dinner."" Luna explained. The people listened intently. ""That potion would allow us to meet in my dream."" Luna continued. The people nodded, signaling that they understood what she said. ""Anyway! We""ll proceed with the making of the potion."" Luna extracted a scroll from her pocket. The lights went off except for the lights on the middle, putting the cauldron into spotlight. She gestured Maya to stand next her. ""First, we""ll need some water from the Gisap River!"" Luna said. A servant appeared and gave Maya a flask. ""Will I pour this in the cauldron?"" Maya asked. Luna nodded. And so, Maya poured the water. Blue smoke emerged from the cauldron. ""Next, we need some Fire lizards."" Luna extracted a strange looking lizard with 4 heads. She handed it to Maya who threw it into the cauldron. ""Next..."" Luna smiled evilly. ""We will now put our special ingredient.."" She nodded at the knight who stood at the door. ""I wonder what the special ingredient is?"" People started whispering to each other. Suddenly, a rope fell from the ceiling. There was a bundle at the very end, which was only a foot away from the surface of the potion. ""May I present to you, the star of this potion!"" Luna announced as the spotlight turned into the bundle, which revealed itself as a human. ""YUUUUUUUUUUTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA?!"" Mito shrieked.",560480
436,"Eli exclaimed, grabbing a napkin to spit it out into. ""Gross!"" ""It can""t be!"" Chloe gasped. ""Really?"" Alya and Mari picked a danish to share, after chewing it for a moment, forcibly swallowed the bites. ""It tastes like someone mixed too much sugar into this filling."" Alya grimaced. Given their danish was a cream cheese and strawberry one, the result would be disgusting. Mari had her fingers pressed to her lips and was staring at the pastry, hard. As a baker""s daughter, she was probably affronted. ""Well don""t trust you!"" Chloe picked up a cream puff and took a bite. ""Ew! This is disgusting!"" Chloe marched over to the phone and called down to the kitchen. Trepidation filled Adrien. He had a bad feeling Chat Noir was going to be necessary after this. ""Chlo, don""t do anything too rash..."" Adrien warned. He tried using her old nickname to soften her up. ""Oh, I""m perfectly calm, Adri-kins! Perfectly! Calm!"" she seethed,before turning her attention to the kitchen staff. ""Send the person responsible for these pastries up here right now!"" A moment passed. ""I want them in my room, yesterday!"" Adrien winced. ""It could just be a simple mistake, Chloe."" ""A mistake my father, the mayor, does not pay this peon for!"" ranted Chloe as Sabrina tried to comfort the distraught heiress. A few minutes later, a stoic young woman came into Chloe""s room, followed by the sous chef. Alya""s mother was out sick for the day. ""Is this the person responsible?"" Choe demanded. The sous-chef hesitated but nodded grimly. He knew he was signing the death warrant of a young career. The blonde attack with ferocious tenacity- something Adrien thought Chloe only had for shopping and Ladybug. ""You stupid, untalented, no-good sorry excuse for a pastry chef!"" She jabbed her finger at the young woman without preamble. ""I""m sorry?"" the young chef frowned. ""You are fired! FIRED! These pastries are disgusting! You made my Adri-kins and Eli-poo barf with this garbage!"" The chef shook her head. ""I don""t understand. I-I was told to come up here to get the tray. I never-"" She looked to her boss, but he looked away. ""What""s going-"" ""You are finished in the culinary industry. Just wait until I tell my father about this. It""s like trying to poison the princess of Paris."" Paris hadn""t had a princess since before the Sun King, Louis XIV, Adrien thought, dread filling his chest. The woman looked confused and teary-eyed, never a good sign with people like Hawk Moth waiting in the wings. ""B-but I didn""t..."" the woman looked ready to cry. ""Chloe, please, think rationally..."" cautioned Mari, a worried look on her face. ""Shut up! I don""t want to see your worthless face in here again! You are fired!"" The woman left the room in tears. ""Wait!"" Mari rushed after her, probably to comfort the woman. Mari was kind that way. ""Ugh, totally ridicule! Well she""s gone now. Get me better snacks!"" she said as she dismissed the remaining chef. ""That wasn""t very cool, Chloe."" Nino frowned. ""Yeah, i mean it was one mistake."" Eli chimed in. Chloe pouted. ""My father said that mistakes like that cannot be mistakes.",3439302
3771,"""I like got the coolest and best idea... let""s plan a welcome home party!"" Steve smiled yet again. ""That""s a great idea Donna!"" Brenda just stood there smiling to herself, it felt just like old times. ""Okay, well Brenda you should go somewhere with somebody while we""re planning it. So who will you go with?"" ""Me"" Everyone turned around to see Kelly get up and walk over towards Brenda. ""We could go shopping, like ol"" times"" Brenda looked down and nodded. ""Cool then scat cats!"" Brenda smiled and hugged Steve and walked off with Kelly, they got in the car and took off. Noah who had been quiet the whole time while everyone exchanged their hugs and hellos with Brenda finally let out a huge sigh, she was beautiful. What was her name again? Brenda.. yes that was her name and she was incredibly beautiful. Noah had thought after Donna had broken up and for good he could never look at another girl, after all he was in love with Donna but the minute he laid his eyes on that girl--- no woman, he knew she would be the girl that would make him live again. She would be his, only ""So what store do you want to go to Brenda? We could go to Stephanie""s they have like the best clothes in the world."" ""Sure"" ""Sure what?"" ""Sure to whatever store we go to"" Kelly bit down on her lip holding back tears, she pulled a strand of her blonde hair and tucked it behind her ear. She did a U-turn and pulled the car to the side of the road. ""What the..."" ""So are we friends or not?"" ""Kelly what are you talking about and why in the world did you stop the car?"" ""Just answer my question or we will never get to your welcome home party get it? So are we friends or not?"" ""You want the truth?"" Kelly nodded. ""Well then we""re not. We were friends actually the best of friends but that changed when you stole Dylan away from me, that one action of yours turned us into enemies"" ""Brenda I said I was sorry, I actually said it a ton of times but everytime you just brush it away. I thought we were friends, I thought we forgot and forgave"" ""Well that was incorrect Miss Taylor"" With that Brenda got out of the car and walked away, but Kelly got up and ran after her grabbing her arm. ""What? Jesus Kelly what do you want?"" ""I said sorry! What else can I do? What else do you want from me?"" ""Nothing. You can do nothing for me and I want nothing from you. You were like the sister I never had, you were my best friend and that is what hurt me the most, if it was anybody else I wouldn""t be this mad but it had to be you! And I can never forgive or forget and we will always be enemies."" Kelly stood there with tears streaking her face. ""Get in the car, we killed enough time"" Brenda sighed and got in the car and they were off. Steve looked out the window and saw Brenda and Kelly walking up. ""Okay people, they""re here! Hide."" Kelly opened the door and they walked into the beach house which was pitch black. Silence filled the room right up until Donna sneezed and Steve dropping a glass. Brenda laughed as they all jumped up yelled surprise. ""Oh! A party for me? I had no idea!",29783
1839,"From off camera, a female voice calls out, ""Maybe it""s a yeast infection. Or maybe you should just try soap!"" Then a dozen or so voices join in laughter at the heavy. Instantly, Heavy""s eyes bulge with anger as she realizes that she""s been prank called. She turns to speak to the mysterious lady on the phone. ""Why you crack sniffing, ass licking, cock sucking slob; when I find you I""m going to dig the Christmas lights out of my attic and use them to light your cunt on fire! You hear me, bitch!? I""m going to make you pick which members of your family I kill first!"" On the phone the prank caller wittily retorts, ""Fuck you, fatso; you couldn""t fight anything that isn""t deep fried."" At that, Heavy freaks out, screaming and throwing her phone across the room and actually taking a big bite out of the ammo crate she""s sitting on. When she finally calms down, Heavy spits out a mouthful of nails and wood before glaring at the camera. ""This interview is over; you edit all that shit out, you hear me?"" The Heavy then picks up her gun, ""If you""ll excuse me, Ms. Redwina Mann is paying me to kill people and it""s been almost half an hour since I murdered anyone.""

When the gate lifts, she""s the first to charge into battle; screaming as loud as she can and unleashing hell. Femme Fortress 2 After the battle at 2Fort, a blood splattered heavy is approached by a young, white Detroit girl with pigtails. ""Hey Heavy, that prank caller get you again?"" Heavy sighs, ""Yeah, Scout, that whore got me again. I swear, next time I""ll get that bitch. And when I do, if you""re there; I hope to god that you just start walking the other way because it""s not going to be pretty."" Scout nods her head and smiles sympathetically, ""Ah you""ll get her; just be patient.""

3048,"""I always respected you, thought you were strong. But if you stay up here crying, I""m going to have to rethink what I think of you."" Mira snarled at that, a bit of her former self coming back, ""Like I care what you think of me."" Laxus smirked at the appearance of old Mira. ""You should. Fairy Tail will be mine someday, and I""ll kick out any weaklings not pulling their weight. Find your fangs again, demon."" ""Fuck you Laxus,"" she had yelled at his retreating form. Mira hated to admit it, but it had been Laxus"" harsh words that caused her to finally heal and begin to get over Lisanna""s death. She knew the master wouldn""t kick her out, but the worry was there, and she and Elfman still had no other place to go, so she began tending bar to pull her weight. She had to adopt a friendlier persona to do her job properly, which had led to the modeling. Both tasks kept her busy enough to gradually come to terms with her missing sister. All because Laxus had been a jerk where everyone else had been compassionate. She wondered how he would react now. He still was a jerk, but so much...better? Was that the word she was looking for? He had changed but not so much that he was unrecognizable. The Thunder Legion began taking more jobs by themselves, wanting to show that they were worthy of Laxus and to get closer to achieving S Class status. This left Laxus at the Fairy Tail bar more by himself. He usually wouldn""t have spent much time at the guild with his friends gone, but he still was making an effort to be friendlier with everyone else. Though he still stayed out of the bar-wide brawls, rolling his eyes at their childishness. Mira found herself talking with him more. Unlike Wakaba and Macao, Laxus wasn""t much older than her. So when he flirted with her, she normally flirted back rather than politely indulged. This was another point where she should have realized that something was different with Laxus because she almost never flirted back with customers past politeness. Their relationship had evolved into a friendship, not that he was as close to her as Erza or her siblings, but she could read him better now. She understood him more. He seemed to have the same feelings towards her, he cared but she wasn""t quite on the same level of his Thunder Legion or his grandfather. Until the day that all changed. It hadn""t started as a different day. Erza and Makarov were gone doing Guild Master work, her siblings and the Thunder Legion were out on jobs, but Laxus had been home since the day before, wanting to wait before accepting the next job. Natsu and Gray had gotten into a fight, which was also no surprise, but the damage had been worse than usual. Bad enough that Laxus had ended the fight, knocking out both of the young men and throwing them out on the street. Most of the bar cleared out after that, as Laxus"" temper wasn""t a pleasant thing to experience. Mira had closed early due to the damage and Laxus had stayed behind to help. ""I appreciate it, but I don""t need your help, Laxus."" Mira pushed against a fallen beam that went nowhere.",1497577
1029,"for the last few days. Van hugged the boy back, ruffling Raven""s hair affectionately. At least he knew what bothered Raven. ""My Raven...I told you before...I don""t care what other people might say...as long as I""m happy..."" It was the sweetest words Raven heard from anyone. ""My Raven..."" Raven looked at those onyx eyes that assured him of security, warmth and love.

Raven, calling out his name, was all that he had heard before passing out... ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------- Raven carried Van back to the cave, laying him into the makeshift bed. Van was breathing hard and felt like he was burning up. The other boy hurriedly took a basin and scoured the area for water, returning back to wash Van. ""Van...what""s wrong? Tell me..."" Raven kept clutching Van""s steadily growing cold hands, trying to warm it up. No reply came, except the wheezing and panting of the other. Raven decided to let Van rest for a while and sleep. Cleaning up after him, Raven spied Van""s memoirs in a corner, it""s pages still open... The pages of the memoir were shifted noisily as Raven read its contents. ""...I don""t know what""s wrong with me. But it all happened that day when I had returned from my rounds across the capital. I felt very dizzy and light headed, and everything passed out... When I woke up, Dr. D informed me I had a rare condition, it seems I had contracted the illness upon exposure to the signals of the Valley of the Rare Hertz...I was diagnosed not to break a series of medications Dr. D had ordered upon me.

""What do we do with him, Jess?"" another who asked. Jesse thought up of a very devious plan and then, snaps his fingers and said, ""I have an idea..."" What did I tell ya? You""ll see plenty more of this Jesse dude in this story. Now you""re probably wondering; where are Jojo and the gang? They""ll be here soon enough. And here""s how the discrimination grows. Chapter 3: Outcast Mexican Days after his first day of school, Lars had hoped that he can start fresh and make some new friends in his new school, but after that encounter with Jesse and his gang, he""s struggling to even find some friends due to the fact that some students were avoiding him or want nothing to do with him because they""ve never seen a mexican person before and had always assumed that mexicans are bad people and are bad influences. Lars knew that statement wasn""t true and as soon as he entered in the school hallways, everyone stopped and stared directly at him while listening to whispering rumors about him and his nationality. ""This mexican kid doesn""t belong here.' ""I bet this kid is gonna kill all of us.' ""Why should his family be here in our country?' ""I bet they""re Mexican terrorists.' Lars sorta heard everything coming out and it was like he""s been rejected by half of the students and have distanced themselves from him instead of getting to know him more. Out of the clear blue, one person shoved him down to the lockers and shouted, ""We don""t need you! Take your ass back where ya came from!"" Most of them cheered this kid on and Lars began to run away from them and headed outside the breezeway and just tried to go straight onto class, hopefully to forget what had happened...but he keeps wondering why they did this. He didn""t do anything bad to them. All he wanted was to say ""hi"" to anyone, but they just didn""t give him that chance. Just then, a few kids came over towards him and he said, ""You Lars?"" Lars looked up at him and replied, ""Yeah."" ""Hey, my name""s Marshall and this is Devon. Jesse told us that he feels really bad about the way he""s been towards you and to prove it, he""s inviting you to a party this Friday night at his house...hoping that he""ll break the ice."" It was unexpected for Lars to hear someone say this and that Jesse actually wanted to make peace with him by a party and he asked, ""You serious?"" ""Yeah. Here""s the address to his house and the party starts at 7:00, Friday night."" Marshall said, giving him the ""address"" to his house and Lars was thinking that it might give an opportunity to let it all go and just be cool with each other. ""I""ll be there then."" Lars said, putting the ""address"" on his pocket. ""Cool, thanks."" Marshall said and ran off.",1276465
598,"""All dead,"" Pride explained, loathing for his brother mixed with tremendous pride at his achievement, ""Without Cane Knightlord to keep them in line they were useless so I killed them all."" ""And Isaac von Kampfer?"" Wrath enquired, referring to Cane Knightlord""s right hand man; the Panzer Magier. ""He died with dignity,"" Pride confessed, ""as much dignity as anyone can die with when their limbs are lopped off with a blunt axe and the living stump is fed to wild pigs."" Evidently, the Panzer Magier""s enormous technological powers were no match for the skills and abilities of Pride. Pride though had enough of his brother""s stalling tactics, ""What do you want, Wrath? Speak quickly for I""m ashamed to even share a planet with greasy scum like you."" Neither homunculus had moved since the start of their meeting; Wrath""s hair and moustache were starting to thaw. ""I""ve found Cain""s brother,"" Wrath put simply. This caused Pride""s eyes to narrow, almost as if the news was too good to be true. Pride eyed his brother with suspicion, ""Are you sure?"" Fifty years ago, unknown location Experimental subject number twelve waited in a dark and desolate dungeon here in the station. The Experimental Station was the official name of citadel built within the confines of the far north. Coal oil had to be brought in at great expense but when the Contra Mundi willed it there was no saying ""no."" The Station had gained a nickname among the few locals who lived in the struggling arctic towns which provided supplies of fish and other scant goods to the Station""s staff. ""Bolvangar"" is what they called it; directly translated the name mean ""Fields of Evil."" A fitting name was never more so for any other place. Over Bolvangar no birds flew, no animals built their burrows and most importantly no people ever trekked who were not invited by the leader of the Rosenkreuz Orden. Bolvangar or the Station was an ugly set of concrete buildings which served mostly as entrances to the underground laboratories where the Rosenkreuz did the majority of its scientific experimentation. Surrounding the facility was a frosted barb wire fence and a garrison of vampires clad in butted chainmail coats and iron helmets stood vigilant guard. For experimental subject number twelve this was the only home he""d ever know. As a baby he""d been sold or stolen and he found himself living here. He was part of a very special group of candidates designated as the Fuhrer Project. He and a hundred others like him were given the finest military training. Everything that they would need to be soldier kings, the children of the Fuhrer Project were given. And at the end of the day their reward was a night""s imprisonment in bleak, impersonal dungeon cells. The Fuhrer children were never allowed to go outside, they were allowed no toys, they could never roughhouse with each other and they were never allowed to have names. They were numbered and that was enough. Number twelve sat in his cell, wearing white shirt and blue slacks.",1220273
1487,"She doesn""t seem to care that bending in that tight red shirt is letting Emma see all the way to China. She""s wearing a black and red bra, Emma notes idly. ""Thanks,"" Emma replies a second late. ""Sorry about the mess."" ""No big,"" Ruby replies with a shrug as she straightens up. Her lips curl sideways, like she knows something Emma doesn""t. She""s lying, but at least it""s a polite lie and not one that matters. ""Thank you,"" Emma replies, watching as the would-be punk goddess wander to the next place that needs to be scrubbed. Granny""s Diner is like hundreds of small-town diners Emma has visited over the course of her life. The food""s mediocre with the exception of truly fabulous pie, but the atmosphere is priceless. There""s always people around, and they all know each other. Emma learns more by listening to the casual gossip than she could by conducting thorough background checks on Storybrooke""s inhabitants. She""s always felt comfortable at diners. They have the perfect balance of hominess and business, of friendship and casual acquaintance. It allows her to feel like an included outsider. Emma is at the diner to meet with Archie. For the last month, they""ve had Thursday dinner with each other, whiling away the time. Originally, they""d just discussed Henry, but they""re gradually broadening their topics. Emma is slowing falling deeply in like with him, and she""s unable to stop herself. Archie Hopper is a righteous man. There is something about him that makes her want to believe in Henry""s delusion, because Archie would make an excellent Jiminy Cricket. She""s not inclined to like people since she""s found they will always disappoint her, but she is making an exception for Archie. He may be gentle, but he has balls of steel when it counts. He""s overly invested in Henry, but she""s not about to object when it""s clear the man wants what""s best for the kid. He""s also prone to running late. She knows that caring for Pongo takes priority to promptness, and when a dog has to go, he has to go now. Some people might be insulted, but Emma knows that the way the owner treats his pet is an important indication of character. Emma can wait, because Pongo can""t. The clock is clearing ten minutes past the hour when he finally hustles in, his face flush from the cold. He apologizes profusely, but she merely smiles and waits for Ruby to deliver him a cup of green tea. ""How have you been?"" he asks once settled. There""s something about him that loosens her usual restraint, so she gives him an honest answer. She tells him about Henry and his visit to the station, which naturally leads into Graham""s sort-of invitation for an evening off together. ""So he asked you out?"" Archie asks, his face alight with intelligence and concern. From someone else, the question might come off as teasing, but she knows he means it sincerely. He is genuinely interested in the answer and not just the gossip. ""Not so directly,"" she said. ""I might have been reading into it too much."" ""Most women know when a man is interested,"" Archie replies softly, shifting in his seat.",1112924
1057,"Mikami-sensei was surprised that Mito was already unconscious. ""MIIIIIITO-NEEEEEEESAAAAAAAAAANNNN!!!"" Yuta shouted back. Yup, the poor special ingredient is Yuta. The people shrieked in shock. Tsujiai, Ayu, Kaji, Mikami-sensei, The prince, Rio and Tama were utterly speechless. ""Yuta?"" Even Nina stopped in her assault as she glanced over the bundle. She shrieked after seeing Yuta. ""YUTA?! What happened to you!? GAH!!!"" She gasped again after seeing the poor beaten man on the floor. ""Nina! You""re back!"" Rio exclaimed. ""How do you like this, Maya? You could extract your revenge on Yuta now."" Luna said. An evil smile crept its way to Maya""s lips. ""Of course..."" Maya let out an evil laugh. ""I am true to my words, Kirishima. When I told you ""You are going to pay"", you are going to pay."" Luna gave Maya a small knife. ""And this is how you""ll pay, Yuta."" ""HELP!!! PLEASE! I AM STILL YOUNG! I STILL WANT TO MARRY-"" Yuta""s eyes widened. Phew! That was close! That one name could change the course of history. Yuta sighed. ""Nina would never understand my feelings..', he thought. Okay. Yuta, you are in a life and death situation right now! No time to daydream about Nina... ""Gah! What are we going to do!? We need to help Yuta?!"" Mito panicked. Kaji, Ayu, Mikami-sensei, the prince, Tama, Rio and Nina started doing various things. It was only Tsujiai who was calm, thinking quietly. ""Hurry! I need something that could help Yuta out of that bundle!!!"" Nina ordered her computer. ""Er... yes."" Nina""s computer responded. Nina loaded some magical beads in the box and said ""practice"". Nina got a small pink candy out it and threw it to Yuta. ""Yuta! Eat that!"" Nina shouted. Yuta hesitantly nodded and caught the candy with his mouth. There was a blinding flash and lots of smoke clouded their vision. When the smoke cleared, Yuta was nowhere to be found. ""Nina?! What did you do to my Yuta-chan?!"" Mito began shaking Nina. Her eyes widened after seeing Yuta""s clothes drop into the cauldron. Black smoke emerged from it. ""Er...um... what.kind.of.magic.was.that?!"" Nina asked her computer uneasily. ""Why is there a cat there?"" Ayu asked. Indeed, there was a very cute cat on top of the bundle. It had light brown fur and big brown eyes. Maya, Luna and the rest of those present in the hall looked at it curiously. ""Well, the magic basically turns the person into a cat."" Nina""s computer responded proudly. ""WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTT?!"" The people in the hall choused. ""But... why did you give me that magic!?"" Nina scolded her computer. ""Er... if Yuta-sama is a cat, then he can escape."" The computer reasoned out. ""Oh, you""re right."" Nina said thoughtfully. Mito was just frozen in the spot. She was looking at the cat. ""Hahaha...HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA!!! My brother is soooo cute when he""s a cat!"" Mito exclaimed. The others also exploded laughing. Yuta the cat growled. ""What a cutie!!!"" ""I want to have a cat like that!"" ""That""s my cat!"" ""No! That is mine!"" ""You""re both wrong. That is MY CHARLOTTE!!!"" Some girls began to fight over the cute little kitty. ""Yuta!",560480

""I know I don""t, but sometimes I wish we could work things out, and try at the whole relationship thing again. I still love you Shay...I still care about you more than you""ll ever know,"" Diego whispered pulling me too him. ""I know, but we""d just mess everything up like we did before. It""s not worth the tears Diego and you know that. I love you too, it""s just not worth it anymore,"" I told him before gazing around to make sure no one was looking before leaning up and placing a light kiss on his lips. Diego stayed there for a moment with his eyes closed before letting me go. ""Well I better be off,"" he said as he opened up his Mustang""s door and jumped in. Turning on the car and pressing a button his top retracted backwards leaving him out in the open. Rolling both his windows down he turned to look at me. ""I guess I""ll be seeing you,"" he said, but before he could even back up the car I stopped him and replied, ""Be safe Diego. Please."" He gave me a sad smile before reaching out to me and pulled me down to his level. Gently he placed a butterfly kiss to my forehead before replying, ""Aren""t I always."" With that he said goodbye and pulled out of the drive and back onto the road. I watched him drive off until I could no longer see his car. Then I turned back and walked up to the house. Upon entering I found the others sitting in living room. Wendy was reading a book and the kids were playing with their toys. Taking a seat next to her I pulled a book off of the table and began to read. No one said a word to me for about an hour until suddenly the sound of the kid""s toys crashing together broke me out of my reverie. ""Hey,"" Mary yelled at her brother as she reached out and grabbed her horse away from him. ""We""re bored"" Billy stated as he looked between Mary and me. ""Please play with us"" Mary said as she turned and gave us the puppy dog eyes. ""Why don""t you ask Matt"" Wendy said as she turned the page in her book. It wasn""t like she was trying to get them off her back, but more so trying to protect me since I wasn""t at all in the mood to deal with them, and because she probably thought it was a good idea for the kids to bond with him. ""Yeah, why don""t you ask Matt,"" suddenly came Matt""s voice from the doorway. Looking up I noticed his stern gaze on the children before turning it toward me. Wendy and I looked between each other before we turned back to look at him. He seemed to have this sort of menacing look about him. It was like he was going to attack one of us at any minute. ""You okay,"" I asked putting down my book to look up at him. ""I""m outstanding,"" he replied with a menacing smirk as he used both of his hands to lean against the doorway. ""Okay, come on, guys. I""ll count to 30, and let""s see if we can find some new hiding places this time,"" Mary said putting down her book now as she got up and began to usher the kids to get up as well. All the while Matt still continued to hover in the doorway with that evil look upon his face.",806976
721,"Chapter 7: Revenge, Despair and the Manly Talk In Alfred""s tent were the medics, him, Aussie, MacArthur and Arthur. The main doctor was checking her heartbeat once again. They also did some check-up until the doctor dawned on a conclusion. ""Good news and bad news, sir."" He told Alfred. ""What""s the news?"" He asked. The doctor checked his files. ""The good thing is she""s alive. But the bad thing is she""s in a state of comatose."" Upon hearing this, a spark of hope was felt by Alfred. ""So, she is still gonna live, right?"" He asked the doctor but the doctor only gave him a sad look. ""We are still unsure of that, Mr. Jones, since it is coma. No one can predict nor know her certain status for now. Plus, she has a heart failure so there""s a possibility that she won""t make it."" Alfred frowned again. ""So, it""s like 50:50, right?"" The doctor nodded. ""More or less."" Then, MacArthur thanked the medics then left. Australia and Arthur walked over to Alfred. Patting his back, Arthur calmly gave him his look of sympathy. Alfred smiled weakly at him. ""Thanks."" He muttered. ""I am so gonna squish him."" The two nations heard the American mutter. He was referring to Kiku, the two nations thought. LATER~ The Allied forces minus Francis and Ivan had a meeting in the Philippines. The infamously known big three namely; Arthur, Alfred and Yao. ""So Alfred, you called us in a meeting about defeating Japan, right? Any ideas?"" The empire asked. He looked at an uneasy Yao after, ""Alright, I""ll ask you, Yao. Any suggestions? Or do you want to say something?"" Arthur asked. Yao stared at him. ""I-I think I can""t fight again with Kiku aru. Ever since the Sino-Japanese war, I felt kinda powerless, aru."" Arthur nodded in understanding. He transferred his gaze at Alfred. ""Alfred, any ideas yet?"" Alfred looked at him. ""You go first."" He finally said. Arthur sighed. ""I was planning to defeat every single base he has. The moment we defeat his bases, we ask him to surrender. If not, Alfred shall fire Kiku""s house using them."" Yao and Alfred looked at Arthur confused. ""Them?"" They both asked. Arthur snickered. ""Little boy and fat man, who else?"" Yao was still confused while Alfred gasped. ""Y-you mean..."" ""Yes."" ""We""ll fire the..."" ""Absolutely."" Alfred nodded in agreement but still, Yao was confused. ""Seriously. These Westerners aru~"" He nodded his head in disbelief. ""Well, meeting adjourned. Tomorrow, we launch our plan."" Arthur declared then left the tent. Yao went out as well leaving Alfred in. He was thinking whether to agree with Arthur""s plan. He shook his head. ""Who am I kidding? Why should I show mercy to him if he didn""t showed mercy to Clara?' Alfred thought. THAT NIGHT~ Alfred sat on the ground where he can see the sky. It was a starry night. A perfect night to spend it with her, he thought. Out of disappointment, he simply sighed. Out of the blue, he felt a hand pat his back. He turned around to see Arthur. ""Want to spend this view with her, right?"" Arthur guessed. Alfred laughed softly. ""Yep."" he replied. Arthur sighed and sat next to him ""Me too, you know.""",2750536
2210,"Marty leapt up from his hiding place and yanked her behind the trailer right as the gunman began firing again. ""Elle, what were you thinking, you could""ve died-"" Marty""s voice went up three octaves on the words. ""They shot Doc, Marty! They shot Doc!"" She shouted back, tears oozing out of the corners of her eyes. ""The Doc""s gone, Marty, he""s gone!..."" ""Oh, come on, Elle, don""t cry, don""t cry,"" Marty said, hurriedly wiping away her tears with his thumb. ""Come on, now, let""s try to get out of here-"" They barely made it two steps before, with a screech from the tires, the blue van confronted them again. Elle shut her eyes, ready for the blow- Click... click... click... Elle opened her eyes a fraction of an inch. The Libyan was slapping his gun repeatedly, trying in vain to make it shoot. Elle risked a glance at Marty, whose eyes were still shut tight. She yanked his arm and pulled him to the DeLorean, diving through the open door. Marty, disoriented, was stuck with the driver""s seat. ""Go, go!"" The gunman shouted angrily. Marty pulled the door shut, started the ignition and floored it, the tires skidding across the wet pavement. They swerved dangerously close to the van before Marty yanked the steering wheel in the opposite direction. When he changed gears to make the car run faster, Elle noticed the time circuits switch on... By this stage the Libyans had reloaded and resumed shooting. Marty drove like a maniac, zigzagging and swerving everywhere to try and confuse them. ""Come on, move, damn it!"" Elle screeched. ""I""m trying, I""m trying!"" Marty retorted, pressing his foot even harder on the pedal. The odometer leapt to 75 miles per hour but dropped again as he drove a hairpin turn around a curb and back into the open space of the vacant parking lot. Marty checked on the Libyans in the rearview mirror: a man was resurfacing not with a machine gun, but with a huge, military-grade missile. Marty""s eyes widened. ""Holy shit!"" ""What?"" Elle demanded. ""Look at that sucker!"" Elle checked her own rearview mirror and almost lost it. ""Oh my God!"" ""Alright, let""s see if those bastards can do ninety,"" Marty said before switching gears again. The DeLorean accelerated, flattening Elle to her seat. Elle glanced at the odometer and as she watched the needle pass eighty-five Doc""s words rang through her mind. ""If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles an hour, you are going to see some serious shit."" Eighty-eight miles an hour. Eighty-eight... ""Marty, watch the odometer!"" Elle finally blurted frantically. ""What?!"" ""Watch the odometer!"" Her words were drowned out by the overpowering mechanical hum of the engine. The neon blue sparks were flying out of the hood, the lightning was engulfing them with blue light- And suddenly they were rolling down a vacant field, accidentally running into a scarecrow in the process. It landed face down on the windshield, smiling eerily at them. They both screamed at the sight, Elle""s so high she was sure she would have cracked the windows.",2855986
1146,"I""ll always be willing to sacrifice my life for you. Just tell me what to do now, and I will follow you to the ends of the world."" Wolfram felt a reassuring strength behind his voice. The power he felt in control of now made him consciously introduce a cocky tone into his words. ""Who must I kill? Tell me everything about these ""friends"" and their betrayals."" Gunter""s betrayal, a couple months after Wolfram became king... Back at the Shin Makoku castle, after some debate, Wolfram became the next King. The she-wolf stayed in the forest, but Wolfram already knew what to do. Once King, he would rally the soldiers most loyal to him and finally accuse his inner court of betrayal against the crown. Something in Wolfram had changed him, but as King they could not openly disobey him. His rule, legal and final with just his words could not be challenged without punishment. Gwendel and Conrad had seen subtle changes in Wolfram, but nothing they had done gave any answers; as the saying goes, ""only more questions.' The changes could have been caused by anything: stress, emotional damage or even being unprepared for the immense responsibilities accompanied with his newfound power. In the end, they both found it better to play along then argue any further then they had been already. ""How do you fare against these charges? What do you say?"" Wolfram looked on from the throne with a stern glare. ""Murder of the former king via mutiny, along with accusations of being a spy, and secret activist for the enemy country. Many soldiers have told me they have seen you send secret letters addressed to the enemy with important information on our itinerates. Gunter. Tell me what you say in your defense? You are the last to be purged from my castle. Permanently."" Gunter knelt silently before Wolfram, his hands shook slightly with anger. He couldn""t do anything, for evidence and eye witness held trial before him. None of it was true; Conrad and Gwendel knew him better than anyone; how loyal he was to the crown. He looked to his friends, but they only came back with angered looks. ""I... have nothing to say."" How could he say anything to this? Gunter wanted to leave this place in a calm, collected matter. Willingly accepting his punishment that didn""t"" fit his crime. ""Fine. I""ve had enough."" He pointed to his brothers. ""You can show me your loyalty now by getting rid of our ""friend"". You were close, were you not? Show me now."" ""I""m sorry,"" he mouthed while Conrad drew his sword from its sheath. His sword rested gently against Günter""s throat. They didn""t have time to tell Gunter about this, so it came as an extreme shock when he had been arrested. Wolfram told the two about his suspicions earlier and the witnesses made it undeniable. People who were friends with Gunter, some of the kind-hearted maids and others spoke their turn. Conrad couldn""t help but feel that this was a giant setup yet debunking this mystery would be tricky. He didn""t have free ground to investigate and he had to constantly keep up façade in front of Wolfram to get closer to the man.",583994

Julius and Elie looked weirdly at him, and Seig mumbled something about ""it wasn""t supposed to be funny"", but nevertheless, they were relieved to see Haru well and good again. It was frightening to see when Haru fell into deep depression. The way his eyes glinted mockery, and how he enjoyed pain and suffering. It seemed that a dark aura enveloped him at that time. And it only worsened when Haru brought a malicious smile at the end of the ordeal, mocking anyone that what he had wasn""t enough. The pain wasn""t enough... But here, Haru regained his composure once more. He was the happy-go-lucky-kid again that the three had come to like. The way his eyes glinted of innate curiosity and innocent childishness; how his laughs would echo the fields of being free from the pain and trouble of the real world. Haru, to them, was like a fresh mountain rain across the arid desert that was their lives. In each and everyone""s mind, they swore to protect him from hurt and pain. Because if Haru was hurt, everyone felt the same degree of pain. But it was Haru that would pain the most. The quartet had arrived at the classroom, much to their discomfort when Gale was also their classmate. Gale just lay back, as if not minding them, but in his mind he was pretty nervous. What if Haru would... ""Mr. Glory. Whatever happened to you? First day of school and you had an immediate trip to the infirmary?""",583064

I said, go!"" he roared the last word with the lung capacity of a mountain lion, along with a little shove pushing her in the way she""d come. And she ran. She felt beyond insulted. In fact, when she tried to think of a word to describe how disgusted she felt, none came to mind. His words echoed in her ears as she ran through the thick foliage, pushing branches out of her face. You""re as stubborn as a mule! It""s no wonder the English couldn""t stand you! She was crying. She wasn""t sure if it was from the boy""s words or from the branches that kept slapping her face. She""d been stupid to think him a friend. Perhaps everything he""d said to her before had been a trick, an illusion to get him on her good side. Perhaps all he had ever wanted to do was bed her, and move on to the next vulnerable wretch to stumble into the court. The trees were thinning out now. She could see exactly where the forest ended and where the field began, and she launched herself into the tall grasses that guarded the nearby pond. Over her pants and gasps for breath she could hear a dog barking, and not long after, a woman""s voice. ""Sterling! Sterling, get back here!"" The dog, Sterling, was now snarling at her. It was a great ugly brute, its fangs bared in a growl as Lyanna neared the stranger. She was sitting near the pond""s shores, holding pebbles in her hand; with a start Lyanna realized it was Mary. ""Sterling!"" Mary commanded again. ""Sit! There""s a good boy."" She turned to Lyanna with a smile. ""I""m afraid you will have to excuse Sterling. He barks at everything. Why, just earlier, he was barking at the forest."" She patted the dirt next to her. ""Please, sit with me. It is lonely here."" Lyanna, too out of breath to protest, obeyed. ""What""s your name?

""What, the pebble?"" ""Yes. You know, he makes and decorates swords sometimes. A hobby, of course. I wanted to give him these, just to help. So do you think he will like this one?"" Lyanna looked at the stone. It was light brown, with flecks of darker brown. ""It""s very nice, Your Grace."" ""I thought so,"" Mary agreed, adding the pebble to the small collection in her palm. ""You and I are very much alike, Lyanna. I would like us to be friends."" ""A-alike, Your Grace?"" Mary waved a dismissive hand. ""You do not have to call me that. Among friends, there are no titles."" She smiled again. ""We are both strangers in a foreign land, are we not? Friends are hard to come by here."" ""I suppose so, yes."" They were quiet for moment. ""Your Gr- Mary?"" ""Hmm?"" she asked as she held another pebble in the sunlight.",2855986
1289,"I sometimes find her watching them intently from amidst the shadows, whatever her intentions are; somehow I seem a bit weary of what they could be. So much for the good old days of when sky pirating meant two people on a treasure hunt, adventure, romance, luxury! It doesn""t quite seem the same anymore, and I can""t quite recall the last time we found any good treasure on a hunt (that I didn""t have to split). Hopefully our little trip to the Lhusu Mines will at least prove entertaining, since I don""t hold that much hope for any sort of treasure or reward. Of course Larsa""s escape from the city of Rabanastre had been a success; in planning ahead, one can do many things that might not seem possible, particularly if the Empire""s guards a placed in every corner of the city. The great sky city of Bhujerba, as it sounds, the city was actually located in the sky. Larsa looked over the side of the bridge leading from the airship port to the city. The sights were absolutely marvelous, and he made a mental note to come back here if, indeed, he ever had time to relax and ""sight see"". Entering the mines was going to be dangerous, no two ways about it. By himself, he had known he probably wouldn""t be able to make it that far alone; yet standing just outside the building housing the lounge for those whom had come from the airships seemed to be the perfect place to start. Under the pretense of exploring the sights, he could quietly scout for a party which looked strong enough to take on the mines and possibly live long enough to still make it out alive. Most of the citizens here were either on vacation or some sort of personal reasons; the few here on business were the ones to look out for. Sometimes, hiding in plain sight was the best way to get the answers needed to continue on. Somewhat unexpectedly, Larsa found the party he had been looking for quite readily. He first heard the name of the Lhusu mines, the group having stopped near his location to talk about it. They mentioned something about monsters and rewards, more then likely being on some sort of hunt. Well, that means they probably wouldn""t mind a little extra help, if he didn""t ask for any of the physical rewards in the end. ""Are you headed to the Lhusu Mines, then?"" The men were tall, having an atmosphere of a mix of shady, ruggedly strong and greedy. Typical sky pirates, Larsa thought in the back of his mind. They stopped their conversation to look down at Larsa. They had to be tall... well, no matter. Height makes no difference in certain skills and scholarly knowledge. ""You have... business there, boy?"" One of the older men asked him. He looked dangerous, but another thing about the man had bothered Larsa. A certain look in his eyes... ""I do. I just need accompaniment into the mines; I have an errand to attend. I can help you out any way you need until our goals are complete. I""m quite good with alchemy and healing."" Larsa responded calmly, his manner straightforward. He didn""t necessarily hide things, but he didn""t straight up lie about it either. A balanced truth, to be sure.",583994
3131,"Kirk shot him a death glare which was considerably lacking when compared to Uhura""s. ""Traitor,"" he mumbled under his breath. ""I trust this personal disagreement will not affect you two working together,"" Pike said, eyebrows raised. Uhura turned to him. ""Not at all. I""m a professional."" ""It""s nice to know someone here is,"" Bones muttered, looking at his best friend. ""What? I""m unprofessional? She slapped me!"" Kirk said, once again seeming incredibly offended. ""Perhaps it""d be best if we moved on,"" Pike suggested. ""As you undoubtedly know, Uhura is a very competent actress, so she will be handling the casing as well as any potential... role playing the job may require."" ""Actress my ass. Con-artist is more like it,"" Kirk muttered under his breath. Everyone else was content to ignore him. ""In addition to Ms. Uhura, we have Montgomery Scott our ballistics expert."" He gestured to a man who was possibly the most Scottish looking person Bones had ever seen, even with the lack of a kilt and bagpipes. ""Call me Scotty,"" he said, reaching a hand out to both Bones and Kirk in turn, a smile stretching across his face. ""Don""t worry, I""m not gonna slap ya,"" he said, amusement in his eyes as he warmly shook hands with Kirk. Kirk grumbled something under his breath, which was, once again, ignored. ""So, Mr. Scott will be in charge of weapons, explosives, and any other devices of a more volatile nature that we may have a need for."" The Scotsman nodded in acknowledgment. Pike moved on to the next person, a younger man who looked like he could be of Japanese or maybe Korean descent. ""This is Hikaru Sulu. He""s the best getaway driver you could hope for and an expert in combat fighting. ""It""s nice to meet you both,"" Sulu said, shaking Kirk and Bones"" hands. ""What kind of combat style are you trained in?"" Bones asked. Sulu smiled. ""I""m a master fencer."" He chuckled at the other man""s surprised and vaguely worried expression. ""Don""t worry, I""m also good with a gun and even know some hand-to-hand combat, so I""m far from useless. Even without a saber."" ""I""m more concerned with how a getaway driver becomes the best,"" Kirk said, smirking. ""Is there some sort of driving test specifically designed for avoiding cops? Did you score the highest?"" Surprisingly, the man in front of him seemed to consider the question seriously. ""Well I""m not sure if you""d count two years as a professional driver for action movies a ""driving test specifically designed for avoiding cops,' but if so, yes I scored the highest."" A small smile at Kirk""s surprised expression proved that the man had accomplished what he meant to. ""And I can assure you that I""m just as adept at driving as I am at swordplay."" Bones chucked and turned back to Pike, and the two men beside him still waiting to be introduced. Well men may have been an exaggeration; one of them didn""t look like he could be more than sixteen. ""This is Pavel Chekov,"" Pike said, motioning to the kid. Clearly Russian, he still had the wide-eyed innocence of someone in grade school.",2943978
2287,"""I like got the coolest and best idea... let""s plan a welcome home party!"" Steve smiled yet again. ""That""s a great idea Donna!"" Brenda just stood there smiling to herself, it felt just like old times. ""Okay, well Brenda you should go somewhere with somebody while we""re planning it. So who will you go with?"" ""Me"" Everyone turned around to see Kelly get up and walk over towards Brenda. ""We could go shopping, like ol"" times"" Brenda looked down and nodded. ""Cool then scat cats!"" Brenda smiled and hugged Steve and walked off with Kelly, they got in the car and took off. Noah who had been quiet the whole time while everyone exchanged their hugs and hellos with Brenda finally let out a huge sigh, she was beautiful. What was her name again? Brenda.. yes that was her name and she was incredibly beautiful. Noah had thought after Donna had broken up and for good he could never look at another girl, after all he was in love with Donna but the minute he laid his eyes on that girl--- no woman, he knew she would be the girl that would make him live again. She would be his, only ""So what store do you want to go to Brenda? We could go to Stephanie""s they have like the best clothes in the world."" ""Sure"" ""Sure what?"" ""Sure to whatever store we go to"" Kelly bit down on her lip holding back tears, she pulled a strand of her blonde hair and tucked it behind her ear. She did a U-turn and pulled the car to the side of the road. ""What the..."" ""So are we friends or not?"" ""Kelly what are you talking about and why in the world did you stop the car?"" ""Just answer my question or we will never get to your welcome home party get it? So are we friends or not?"" ""You want the truth?"" Kelly nodded. ""Well then we""re not. We were friends actually the best of friends but that changed when you stole Dylan away from me, that one action of yours turned us into enemies"" ""Brenda I said I was sorry, I actually said it a ton of times but everytime you just brush it away. I thought we were friends, I thought we forgot and forgave"" ""Well that was incorrect Miss Taylor"" With that Brenda got out of the car and walked away, but Kelly got up and ran after her grabbing her arm. ""What? Jesus Kelly what do you want?"" ""I said sorry! What else can I do? What else do you want from me?"" ""Nothing. You can do nothing for me and I want nothing from you. You were like the sister I never had, you were my best friend and that is what hurt me the most, if it was anybody else I wouldn""t be this mad but it had to be you! And I can never forgive or forget and we will always be enemies."" Kelly stood there with tears streaking her face. ""Get in the car, we killed enough time"" Brenda sighed and got in the car and they were off. Steve looked out the window and saw Brenda and Kelly walking up. ""Okay people, they""re here! Hide."" Kelly opened the door and they walked into the beach house which was pitch black. Silence filled the room right up until Donna sneezed and Steve dropping a glass. Brenda laughed as they all jumped up yelled surprise. ""Oh! A party for me? I had no idea!",29783
429,"The boy then notices Ranma and Akane, the minute he says, ""Humans are interesting"", he goes back to walking to the graveyard. Ranma then says, ""O...k...things got even weirder, with or without evil around! Why do I have to go to school anyway Akane?"" Akane then says, ""First off, it""s mandatory and second, You""re the heir of the Saotome Mansion so you need the education."" Ranma then says, ""Well... hey, why is there a horde of males guarding the front of the school?"" Sure enough, Ranma and Akane then see hundreds of men dressed in sports gear, some of them are boxers, baseball players, sumo wrestlers, tennis players, etc. Akane then gets angered and says, ""Oh no... not this again! You see, before Tatewaki Kuno went nuts and became the Riddler, he said that if anyone can beat me, they can date me... I hate it when they do this to me this morning! In fact, I imagine they are the criminals!"" Akane then fights the boys who keep chanting, ""Go out with me Akane!"" Ranma then asks, ""Akane, can I help you?"" Akane then says, ""I don""t need your help!"" Then the boys see Ranma and they""re shocked. The actor in the godzilla suit says, ""Oh my! You""re Ranma Saotome...heir to the Saotome fortune..."" Then another actor dressed as a man from Edo times says, ""I take it that this lady must be your fiancee"" I guess we have no choice but to give up our pursuit of Akane. The boys run off and Ranma looks at Akane and says, ""At least they stopped..."" Akane then says, ""I could""ve beaten them up without you!"" Unknown to the two, a strange teenager overhears the two and is carrying a huge spatula. Ranma and Akane then enter the building and then they see a strange man in a hawaiian shirt and shorts, he has a tan and a topknot. The strange man has his fingers ties to strings and it is tied to pineapples and guava fruits on the ceiling and he is playing his ukeleilei and making them move up and down and then he sings, ""Keikei would you like some fruits? Keikei would you like some fruits? Keikei would you like some fruits?"" Then he notices Ranma""s pigtail so he goes up to Ranma and while holding scissors he says, ""Demerit fo"" de long hair brudda!"" Then Ranma delivers him a kick to the head and says, ""Who do you think you are? ""Czar Baldy Bald the fourth""?"" The strange man then says, ""What""s da matter brudda? can""t take a JOKE?"" AHAHAHAHA!"" Ranma then asks Akane who was he, then Akane answers, ""Believe it or not, he is the Principal of the school... he has been mysteriously absent for three years when he returned from Hawaii, he came back a few months ago and with an obsession for both conformity and all things Hawaiian, including his very dark skin and a fake Hawaiian accent...and even before he was like this, he liked to play practical JOKES on the students... but if he stays out of line I shall consider him a criminal. Ranma then says, ""I""d rather face Riddler again that have to fight the Prinicipal, he seems to be a martial artist too."" Ranma and Akane then attend the class of Hinako Ninomiya who is starting a lesson on ""ticks, fleas, mosquitos, and other PARASITES"".",910821
927,"It takes her awhile to admit it, but this discovery is the death knell for any hope she might have had in happy endings. The movies had always promised a joyous reunion for an orphan when they found where they belonged. Even that little kid who had to be rescued by talking mice was handed a family in the end. Emma isn""t going to get that. She can at least take the satisfaction that she did better by her son. She gave up her parental rights to get him properly adopted. It was the hardest thing she""s ever done, and while she may regret that he""s not in her life, she""s coming to terms with it. It may mean she will never see him or know what he becomes, but that uncertainty is worth the chance he has at a good life. Emma spends the entire movie watching her son instead of watching the film. The theater is about half full, and most of the patrons are closer to Henry""s age than her own. This film is riding a nostalgia wave, but Emma isn""t engaged on that level. She has vague memories of watching The Muppet Show on Nickelodeon, but was never that interested and doesn""t recall any of the details. Instead, she focuses on Henry since he""s the most fascinating thing in her life. It""s always to think that this amazing little person came from her. He""s so intelligent and lively, and there""s always something going on in his head. Having the chance to just sit and stare at him is a luxury she never thought she could afford. When the movie ends and the lights come back up, Henry is full of energy. Sitting in a dark theater is a challenge for any child, even one as naturally introverted as Henry. He can""t wait to share everything he""s thinking. Emma lets him babble, not contradicting any of his opinions about how fun the movie had been or why he thinks Kermit is the epitome of cool. She collects the empty popcorn tub in order to bin it and lets it wash over her, enjoying the moment. Henry belatedly notices she""s not contributing much to the conversation. ""Did you like it?"" Emma hates the idea of a ""happily ever after"" because life doesn""t work like that. The only unchangeable ending is death; if there""s life, then the story is still continuing. She didn""t enjoy the movie because she can""t suspend her disbelief long enough to buy into the happy ending. But she""s not going to tell Henry that. ""It was a Disney film,"" she says instead. It""s not lying if you avoid the issue. ""I thought you said everyone likes Disney."" The brilliant smile he gives is enough to sooth any misgivings she might have about misleading her child. Henry tells her they""re definitely going to see Brave together when it comes out, and next time they can sneak M&Ms into the theater. It""s supposed to be in 3-D, which means the film is going to be even more awesome. ""We can go to the show right before dinner and then go to the diner,"" he tells her, just assuming that his plans will be fine with what she wants. She looks at his face, and wishes she could promise that. But she doesn""t know where she""s going to be in six months, and she doesn""t want to make any promises she cannot keep.",1112924
1866,"Still, I couldn""t help but pay attention to Haruhi as she began to read the letter... Greetings Brigade Chief,Although you""re probably not very used to things like this, the letter you are reading is intended for you and your SOS Brigade club. I""m an American teenager who has recently started my own version of your genius SOS Brigade idea in my high school. I only have a few members, but I can tell you we are just as dedicated to finding strange phenomenon all over the world as you must be! We managed to find your site by mistake one day, and I got so interested in it, I decided I would start an American branch of the SOS Brigade. But, I know that permission is needed from the original Brigade Chief, so me and my members have decided to journey all the way to Japan to meet you and your members! I""m glad I actually decided to learn Japanese; otherwise I wouldn""t be able to write this letter. I look forward to meeting you and all your club members!Sincerely, K Haruhi seemed to just blow up with happiness after reading that letter. It was good, since I could tell her old, hyper, eccentric personality was swiftly returning. I was getting worried at the signs of melancholy she had shown these past few days. But many questions were already racing through my thoughts. For example, how the hell did this American know Japanese so well? Unless the letter was in English, and Haruhi somehow could read English, and just never told us. Plus, how did they find the webpage anyway? And why would they consider something as insane as making their own SOS Brigade? I mean, I was forced to join, but they voluntarily made themselves members? And not to mention why the hell someone would want to copy some obscure club from Japan! Plus, the writer is really being a Haruhi kiss-ass. Sounds like someone Koizumi might get along with. And why would the send a letter all the way to Japan? Wouldn""t e-mailing be easier? And what""s with the single initial too? But as I ponder on these many questions, everyone else seems to just be listening Haruhi, who has just begun her talking spree. ""I knew that the website was a great idea! All thanks to my genius as Brigade Chief, of course!"" she announces, and as always, it""s annoying that she never gives me even a tiny bit of credit. That""s typical Haruhi for you. ""I can""t wait for these foreigners to arrive! We""ve got so much to show them regarding the original SOS Brigade! Plus, once they find out all the things their club is probably doing wrong, I""ll have them bowing down to their new international Brigade Chief in no time! Me and Mikuru-chan will wear our old bunny-girl costumes when they arrive, because I know they wouldn""t be able to resist something like that...."" At this point, I""m half-listening to Haruhi and her ideas. She still has the notion to go on, mostly because Asahina-san and Koizumi are still actually listening to her. Even after being constantly abused by Haruhi, Asahina-san still can""t help but be her sweet self towards her. It""s kind of sad, really.",967934
3780,"""No! I won""t!"" she exclaimed, voice high pitched with horror. ""I know,"" he sighed, ""your convictions are too strong. Your faith is too strong. It would ruin you."" Tears filled Aurora""s eyes. The thought of trying to deliberately kill someone was overwhelmingly sickening. In her heart, however, she knew that anyone was capable of murder if they were put in bad enough circumstances. Thankfully, her tears only lasted for a moment. He was grateful for that; he didn""t think he could handle seeing her cry the way she had when her wings had come in. Sliding one hand under her chin, he guided her face up so that she was looking at him. ""For being Iracebeth""s sister, you""re so different,"" he remarked, ""your only fault is that you care too much."" A watery post-cry smile graced her features. She knew she must have looked like a wreck; her face was red and blotchy, her nose was running, and her eyes were red and scratchy. ""I want you to go to Marmoreal,"" he told her, ""and get as far away from here as you can. Get away from the death and the destruction....spend some time with Mirana and the others. As many absolute lunatics as she keeps company with, they""re completely harmless and they treat strangers well. You""ll be safe there."" He noticed that she was leaning into his touch. Her cheek was warm and sticky against his bare palm. His gloves had come up missing at some point during the chaos, but he didn""t care at the moment. ""But what about you?"" she asked, voice slowly beginning to steady. What about me? No one""s really asked that before... ""I""m sure I""ll manage."" Her dark eyes seemed to bore into him. There was a visible charge in the air, a tangible ripple of energy that extruded out from her. It seemed to surround him like a second skin. He felt her presence at the very edge of his thoughts, but it stayed all around the outside. He could sense something there... He let his own defenses back down just the slightest bit where only her feelings would come through. He could sense fear, not for herself, but for him. She was worried about him. The obviousness of physical health was there, but there was fear for his heart as well. She was afraid he""d be trapped here indefinitely, both in body and spirit. He eased the wall down further. He imagined it as being one less row of bricks high. Another feeling came through. She wanted him to go with her. She wanted to know that he was safe, to see it tangibly that he was safe. She wanted some sort of proof. Her concern was very touching. No one, save Dr. Hathaway, seemed to truly give a damn about him. Iracebeth and the other ladies around here wanted him for his power, for what they could gain from his physical strength and his cool, calculating mind. She wanted him for entirely different reasons. One more row of bricks was banished from his mental wall. A memory came through, playing like a movie in the back of his mind. From Aurora""s point of view, it was the night she""d taken Dr. Hathaway""s experimental potion. It was when she""d woken up, disoriented and frightened from her latest nightmare.",870118
2470,"""But I""m not sure if it""s a good idea - Hikaru is,"" he hesitated, trying to find a polite word to describe him, ""rambunctious."" ""Many Go players have their own little peccadilloes,"" his mother said. ""I""m sure it will be fine. Next Saturday would work out very well - if you want, I can call his parents to make arrangements."" Akira shut his eyes, taking a deep breath to remain calm. It wasn""t worth pointing out that he was fifteen years old; his mother had made up her mind, and wouldn""t be stopped until she got her way. Her quietly implacable personality was like a force of nature. ""I""m sure that won""t be necessary,"" he replied instead. ""Good,"" his father said, releasing a braying laugh. ""I""ve been meaning to ask your brat of a friend a couple of questions."" ""Please don""t. I want him to stay my friend."" Akira wasn""t above begging when it came to mitigating his father""s pushy tendencies. His mother set a hand on Akira""s shoulder reassuringly. ""We won""t embarrass you, Akira,"" she promised, before casting a stern look at her husband. ""Right?"" His father scowled, but knew better than to argue. ""Yes, dear,"" he agreed, but his face drew itself into an unhappy frown. ""Is dinner going to be ready soon?"" ""Another hour, which should give you time to finish with your cigar and answer some of your fan mail,"" was the response. Akira could only shake his head at his parents, amazed as always at his mother""s firm control of their marriage. His father may have been the Honinbou and most respected person in the entire Japanese Go world, but none of that mattered when Kuwabara Kouko made up her mind about how things needed to be. During dinner, his father pontificated on the state of Go world, lamenting the lack of upcoming talent with the notable exception of his son. Akira, who had heard the spiel many, many times before, tuned him out through long practice, instead letting his mind wander to his plans for later in the evening. While Akira wasn""t sure he wanted to continue to pursue professional Go for the rest of his life, he loved the game more than anything else in the world. He knew that two of the best net Go players would be meeting on line tonight, and he fully intended to watch the entire game, no matter how late it kept him up. After finishing his homework - he needed to ensure his grades were good in case he decided to attend college - Akira turned his computer on and logged onto The Internet Go Server to witness the match. SAI was already on line, he noted, but his opponent hadn""t shown yet. Akira listened carefully, waiting for the unmistakable light-tread of his mother ascending the stairs. After the door to his mother""s sewing room shut, he smiled knowingly. Less than a minute later, the renowned net Go player KOUYO appeared. As the game opened between the two most famous Net Go players, Akira wished he had the courage to walk over to his mother""s room to watch her play. But she had never told anyone that she played Net Go, and it was her secret to keep.",1112924
2431,"Miyazawa was the prettiest girl in class, after all. I met her outside the shoeboxes. She was holding her outdoor shoes in one hand, and rummaging through her box with another. I noticed how she pulled out two love letters, looked at them for a second, before I opened my own. To my relief, today was one of those rare days when I didn""t have any inside waiting for me. I looked at her as she blushed at me slightly. ""Admirers?"" I inquired. ""You should know,"" she teased me playfully. ""Maybe one of these was put into my box by mistake?"" she suggested. ""Um. I doubt it..."" I said, though it was a possibility. When I had been in junior high, it had happened about four times -- misdirected love letters. The result of one of the incidents had been downright hilarious, but once the poor girl had been so humiliated she had transferred schools. The human heart is a funny thing. With a sigh, she pulled on her indoor shoes onto her feet before turning to the letters with slightly tired eyes. She opened one, read it quickly, then opened the other. Miyazawa looked thoughtful for a minute before she opened a day planner and scribbled a few notes in it. I wanted to ask her who they were from, but I knew it was none of my business. I wanted to take them out of her hands and shred them to pieces. I was startled by the urge. I barely knew her. She gave me a smile. ""Do you know Enomoto-kun?"" she asked. I blinked. ""Isn""t he in class D?"" I asked. Miyazawa frowned thoughtfully. ""I think so. I just can""t place the face to the name,"" she confessed, and then she looked guilty. ""I""m supposed to meet him at lunch."" I almost offered to go with her. Stupid me. Miyazawa could handle herself. She gave me a smile. ""Chiyako-san still isn""t dating anyone, is she?"" ""Not that I know of."" A week ago Asano Chiyako had given me a love note, and as far as I knew, she still hadn""t recovered from my gentle rejection enough to pursue another boy. ""Hmm... I think she""d get along nicely with Tamura-kun. Maybe I should redirect his attention that way,"" she mused aloud, tapping her pen against her chin. ""Redirect?"" I echoed. She nodded. ""I really don""t think Tamara-kun and I""d make a good couple- but he and Chiyako-san have a lot in common, and she""s desperate for a date."" I smiled at her. It had never occurred to me to redirect the attention of my admirers, but Miyazawa was a lot more considerate than I was. I usually just tried to turn girls (and the occasional guy) down as gently as possible; Miyazawa tried to do something constructive. I really liked that. It was something to consider in the future, though I doubted I""d have much luck as a matchmaker. ""Ready to go to class?"" I asked. ""Hmm?"" she said, slightly distracted as she put the love notes safely in her bag. ""Since we""re both heading that way, I thought we could walk together?"" I offered. ""Oh, sure,"" she said, shutting her shoebox and rising to her feet in one lithe movement. We walked down the hallway, and I was more aware than ever of the stares that were following me... but these stares were different. They were speculative.",1112924
3686,"Dr. Gosunkugi aka Scarecrow was the first to deal with Gotham Ward""s new defender of the night, but what next challenge will our hero face next? Ranma Saotome and Kasumi Tendo, and with the help of the Jusenkyo Guide, have finally finished designing and building...""The Girlcave""! A inner sanctum for Ranma, made for storing his arsenal, used to plan his next move to prevent crime in Gotham Ward, a place to train for upcoming battles, and it is set up to resemble a small shopping mall since girls are known for hanging out in malls. Like in a mall, all of Ranma/Girlman""s utilities are stored in many sections of this place. The sports store is where the weapons and arsenal are stored and tested, the food court is where Kasumi makes her cuisine, a perfume shop where chemicals are tested and examined, the department store is where the girl-suit and spare girl-suits are stored, a museum for trophies from Ranma""s adventures are stored such as Scarecrow""s mask, a auto shop where the Girlmobile is stored and repaired, a Tendo Dojo where Ranma trains (Soun apparently started a franchise), and a internet cafe coffee shop is where Ranma""s computer equiptment is stored at and where he spends his time the most, watching over the city for when evil rears it""s ugly head. With each new addition, the girlcave will become bigger than last time and will resemble more of a mall. Ranma then thanks the guide for his help and Kasumi then says, ""Mr. Jusenkyo Guide, with a voice like that, you can narrarate documentaries about cute penguins."" The guide blushes and goes back to china with one of Ranma""s heli-copters. But then, Ranma is now going through a serious problem he just remembered, the next charity event is taking place at a pool party. And as he remembers, if he gets splashed by cold water, he will turn into his cursed girl form (aka Girlman) and his identity will be exposed, yet he has a reputation for NEVER missing a charity fundraiser and this fundraiser is for getting ""Weird Al"" Yankovic a star in Hollywood...that and for the MDA. And so as he tries to find a way to get out of this one, his computer in the Girlcave picks up a report about a demented circus troupe terrorizing the pool party and trying to make off with the charity money. Ranma then sees the ""Girl-signal"" beamed into the sky and then pours cold water on him/herself puts on a black suit, she then wears a mask that exposes her pigtail. And then she puts on a utility belt. Ranma then says, ""Take note of this Kasumi but I will only say this once...I""m glad criminal activity just protected my idenity...I""ll repay those crooks with a one way trip to Arkham!"" Girlman then jumps to the Girlmobile and drives to the pool party. Girlman then sees what appears to be clowns in Skull masks in motorcycles, terrorizing those in the pool area and then Clowns in scuba gear attack those in the pool. Girlman then has the Lifeguards tell everyone to run out of the rool while Girlman takes care of the ""pool scum"".",910821
1338,"This is it...will Morrison drop the ball on the coach? How will he react? Stay tuned to find out! And the moment we""re anxious to hear...how will the coach react? Chapter 14: Stepping Down from Track Morrison followed the coach over to his office and he took a seat as he was waiting to see what""s going on and he just twiddled his thumbs, unsure about what might come out soon, but he knew that the time would come to step down from the game, but surprisingly enough, Trevor isn""t the reason to step down from it. The coach sits down, face to face with one of his star athletes and he looks at Morrison, who wears a very worried look on his face and he said, ""Do not worry, Morrison. You""re not in any trouble whatsoever."" But that was the least of his worries now and he took a deep breath and only said, ""That""s good to hear."" ""Now, I know you didn""t start the tussle while practicing. I do not know what is the deal with Trevor or what""s going on between you two, but I just need to know what is going on in your mind after all this had happened."" the coach answered. Morrison took a deep breath, looked at the coach in the eye and responded, ""I didn""t know what was Trevor""s problem with me. I couldn""t even respond quickly or react because I had to get back to practice and keep focus on completing the task. I think has something personal against me and I""m still not sure why. So...the only thing in my mind was ""what""s gotten into him?' Like, what have I done that made him act that way towards me."" ""Well, don""t worry...I""ll have a long talk with him after this. And don""t worry, he""s cut from the games and the team. We still need you around for the big game on Friday."" the coach added. Morrison nodded his head in agreement and then, he paused for a second and with a look into his eye, he said... ""That""s what I need to talk to you about, coach."" The coach was quickly surprised to hear that come out of Morrison""s mouth and said, ""What about it?"" ""Well...I""ve been giving it some thought and while I am looking forward to the game, it may be my last competition and training for track."" Morrison replied, with a hint of anxiety in his voice during the last part. That seemed to stun the coach for a while, but at the same time, he wasn""t quite surprised by Morrison""s sudden decision. He just didn""t expect it to come inadvertedly a few days before the game. He sat back down lower and responded, ""Explain why."" He wasn""t sure exactly how to explain it, but once he did explain his reasons for doing so because he wanted to focus more on what he loves to do-which is music or whatever interests that suited him-the coach listened to every single word and had been aware of the young cheetah prodigy""s music abilities and after Morrison said his piece, the coach said, ""That""s a good reason."" ""There""s a part of me that really wanted to keep doing track, but there""s another part that maybe I should pursue something better, something bigger than myself. And also because I wasn""t sure if I can balance music and track along with being social, schoolwork and home life.",1276465
2683,"TK nodded back. ""Alright. Tomorrow...I will ask Iwasawa-san on a date...even if it kills me!"" Matushita announced in a powerful voice, which almost surfaced above the sound of instruments playing in the club room. Around the corner, a dark figure watched with copper eyes as the two boys confirmed their plans. Shiina had been thinking to herself about how exactly to deal with her TK problem for the last couple of days. Her mouth forming into a small smile, she realized quickly that she had just found her solution. T.K ""So you""re telling me...that you are gonna be asking Asami Iwasawa on a date before break is over?"" Fujimaki asked from across Matsushita as break period dragged on. The stoic judo expert nodded in response, and TK snapped his fingers. ""TK said he would assist me...but yes. I am."" Matsushita replied, his voice very sincere. Fujimaki seemed to be thinking something over for a few seconds, before he narrowed his eyes at the judo expert. Crossing his arms, he made it sound like he was talking down to the judo expert, ""I feel sorry for you. You""ve actually had your heart captured by a girl. And not to mention that there""s no way in hell she""s going to just say yes. She doesn""t even know you exist."" ""You sound awfully sure of all this. When was your last girlfriend, Fujimaki-kun?"" Hisako said from behind the fight-holic, surprising him easily. TK and Matsushita took little notice towards her, but Fujimaki seemed suddenly flustered. ""Wha...Why do you care anyway? Can you stop this whole sneaking up thing? It""s damn well getting on my nerves!"" Hisako giggled as if Fujimaki had made a funny joke. The fight-holic""s face just seemed to become more annoyed the more he heard Hisako""s laughing. She stopped quickly however, apparently to put in her own two cents about what they had just been talking about. ""You guys really suck when it comes to keeping secrets. Half the class already knows about Matsushita""s 5th Dan""s crush. It""s only a matter of time before it gets to Iwasawa..."" Hisako stated, her voice trailing off purposely in an effort to make Matsushita nervous. It worked pretty well, and the judo expert""s response made him sound worried. ""You...you wouldn""t tell her, would you?"" Hisako smiled big at first, but her smile shrunk quickly. ""Nah. I wouldn""t do that. I do have a little advice for you though. Iwasawa is my best friend, so I know her pretty well inside and out."" ""Don""t be afraid. Don""t stop dancing!"" TK interjected, patting Matsushita on the back to reassure him. Of course, the bandana-wearing teenager still hadn""t completely figured out exactly how he would be helping the judo expert get a date with Asami Iwasawa. ""Okay. What can you tell me about her? Is there something that she likes about guys in particular? Should I buy her an expensive gift?"" Matsushita asked, bolting off the first questions that came into his head. For the longest time, he had always thought that girls always fell for expensive presents like jewelery and such.",967934
2478,"Meiko wondered if the woman thought she was doing a good job hiding where her hand was. She pasted a pleasant smile on her face, agreeing to bring out something wonderful. When she got into the kitchen, she couldn""t keep from bursting into gales of laughter. ""What""s so amusing?"" Nanako wanted to know as she balanced a tray of dirty dishes. ""It""s nice to see a lady with a man so thoroughly twisted around her... little finger,"" Meiko replied. ""Though I do wonder how much of her attraction is to his bank account."" ""You mean the blond and redhead I saw Akari seat in your section a couple minutes ago?"" ""Yes,"" Meiko said, unable to suppress a snicker. ""The quintessential man eater and her hapless prey."" ""Oh,"" Nanako said, and turned around to set the tray down where the dishwasher could easily collect it. Surprisingly, she didn""t add anything else. Meiko looked at her senpai, wondering if she was missing something. ""Spit it out,"" she said after a long moment, deciding a direct approach was best. ""It""s nothing, hon,"" Nanako demurred. ""Don""t you have an order to get to the chef?"" Meiko gasped slightly, a hand reflexively covering her mouth. ""I almost forgot!"" she exclaimed in horror, the lack of attention to her work flustering her tremendously. The chef cheerfully agreed to match the bottle of red zinfandel the bartender had provided. He liked couples that let him experiment with the menu, because the bistro attracted far too few adventurous types for his liking. Most diners preferred to stick with ""tried and true"" meals. She returned a couple minutes later, ready to serve the wine, and hoping that her tardiness hadn""t been noticed. She showed both of them the label, and the woman nodded with approval. ""That should be fine,"" she said, smiling as she stroked the hand of her dinner companion. Meiko cut the casing and removed the cork, pouring out a couple tablespoons worth of the valuable liquor (which retailed for around 40,000 yen a bottle). The woman took it from her gracefully, holding the glass up to the light to inspect the color as she swirled it to check the wine""s legs. A smile curved her (red, red) lips as she held it under her nose to smell the bouquet. Then she took a sip, letting the wine linger on her tongue before swallowing. ""Very good,"" she said, before indicating Meiko should finish pouring the wine. Meiko finished pouring, unable to avoid noticing the smooth elegance of the woman as she raised her glass again. After setting the bottle on the table, she went to fetch the hors d""oeuvres. Chef had outdone himself, she thought as she saw the lobster bisque he had whipped up, served in tiny demitasse cups with spoons garnished with dollops of crème fraîche. It was a bit unconventional, but this couple seemed the type to appreciate it (or the woman would, and anyone looking at the two could tell who had control in that relationship). She made her way back through the restaurant, noticing how the woman was actually leaning against the man""s arm. His eyes were fastened on his date""s face, which made Meiko pause for a bit.",1112924
2866,"Instead, he turned suddenly, pushing Satine behind him, so her back pressed against the wall that surrounded the town. He stood between her and the ever-growing throng people that surrounded them. Now would be a good time to have a lightsaber, he thought wryly. Although for the most part, the townspeople appeared to be nothing more than simple villagers, he had learned long ago that you could never count out a Mandalorian regardless of their station. Almost all had been trained in combat since birth, meaning a farmer could be just as deadly as an assassin or bounty hunter, and more than a match for an unarmed jedi padawan and a pacifist duchess. The crowd was pressing in on them, led by the man who had first recognized Satine. ""We live in hell, mhi cuye o""r dar""yaim, while this hut""uunla Duchess, this dar""manda, runs away and conspires with the Jetiise!"" ""Stay back,"" Obi-Wan warned. The crowd didn""t listen, just pressed forward. He took a step backwards. ""I say we give her over to the bounty hunters-split the reward,"" the second man added. ""Gra""tua par Mandalore!"" Soon the cry carried through the crowd. ""Gra""tua par Mandalore! Gra""tua par Mandalore!"" ""I""m guessing they""re not surrendering,"" Obi-Wan whispered drily to Satine, taking another step back, so he was practically on top of her. With no more room for him to retreat, the crowd finally halted. They were completely surrounded-if he reached out a hand, he could practically brush the chest of the leader. Satine didn""t respond; she was too busy staring into the mob. Obi-Wan followed her gaze, and saw that the old woman from the booth had joined the crowd. Though he wasn""t exactly surprised, he could practically feel the sadness and weariness rolling off the Duchess. ""Don""t come any closer,"" Obi-Wan said, addressing the man in front in particular. ""I don""t want to hurt you."" The man laughed derisively. ""Arrogant little Jetii."" He took a step forward, so he and Obi-Wan were mere inches apart. ""I will crush you."" The man raised his fists and Obi-Wan raised his own hands, ready to force-push him back. ""STOP!"" Ridiculously, Satine""s cry was so unexpected it actually worked-both Obi-Wan and the man turned to her in surprise. Before he was completely cognizant of what was happening, she had slipped under Obi-Wan""s raised arms and pushed him back, so he was pressed against the wall and she stood unprotected before the mob of angry Mandalorians. His shock was matched by the man he had been about to fight, who, somewhat ironically, looked unsure of how to proceed, now that the exact thing he wanted was standing before him. The Duchess however exhibited none of his hesitation. Looking to the crowd, she calmly removed her hood. ""I am Satine Kryze of Clan Kryze, Duchess of Mandalore."" She paused a moment before continuing. ""I beg you to let us go without violence."" ""What are you doing?"" Obi-Wan whispered fiercely, trying to maneuver around her. She pushed him back with surprising force. ""Let me handle this, Obi,"" she whispered back. ""Not all of us have forgotten our heritage.""",2943978
1726,"Seeing his confusion, I realized that Jon really didn""t know what a Paramour was, or at least didn""t know enough, ""It""s a Dornish thing. When a Lord or Lady falls in love, but cannot marry that person for whatever reason - social standing, already married, et cetera - they take that person as their Paramour. It""s like a mistress, but usually open and acknowledged. Some are even wives in all but name."" When Jon stopped abruptly, my hand was almost ripped out of his, ""You think I want you as my... as my mistress?"" He looked disgusted at the thought, but I couldn""t understand why. It was a normal thing in Dorne, and though I knew they preferred to sneak around and conspire about love and infidelity outside of Dorne, I didn""t expect it to be met with such... disgust. ""I mean, I assumed-"" He gripped my hand like a vice, ""I would never disrespect you like that."" ""Disrespect?"" My mouth gaped, but I snapped it shut quickly, ""Jon, where I come from everyone is more honest about these things. I am a bastard, you are the King of Westeros. Even though my father is Hand of the King, you are still miles above me in social standing-"" It dawned on me. My hand slipped from his as I took a step back, ""Wait. You... you mean to court me... for marriage?"" To be... Queen of Westeros? I, bastard of House Lannister? Jon""s brow furrowed, ""Of course I do."" My blood ran cold as my brain sped faster, ""But... no one would accept that. A bastard for their Queen? Not even in Dorne could a ruling house be headed by a bastard, much less a noble married to one."" ""You""re a lot more than just a bastard, Synne."" ""Maybe not to you or Father or Missandei or even your sisters,"" I ran a hand through my hair. A lump grew in my throat. Jon had made me imagine the impossible, damn him! ""We peasants may have a bit more freedom choosing spouses than nobles, but at least I still know that love factors little into it."" ""I would prefer you to some simpering noble girl."" My head snapped up, ""Is your sister simpering? Is Arya? There""s probably hundreds of trueborn noble girls much better suited to being Queen than me."" Jon scoffed, ""The ones I""ve met, with few exceptions, ""ave been all flattery. They want the crown and nothing else. You-"" He stepped towards me. I stumbled back, ""-""ave challenged me. Talked to me as an equal. Surprised me. And didn""t you say that the ones who don""t want a powerful role are the ones best suited to it?"" ""Jon, I am a bastard."" ""Aye, as I was once,"" Jon said, ""And even before my birth parents were known, the people of the North were willing to crown me King. Before even Sansa, who is the eldest Stark. Birth means much, but never as much as we assume."" ""You... You just don""t get it!"" I wanted to scream at him. Shout with all the strength of the little girl inside me, ""I am not a Queen. I""m not a proper lady. I can""t sew like Sansa, or defend myself like Arya. Even in the Red Keep, I see how people whisper about me. I""m a bastard, and that might mean little in Dorne and not as much here, but that means a lot in King""s Landing.""",748687
1718,"He wrenched Italy from the door just as he got it open, slipped inside, and shut the thick door before I could see much inside at all. What I did see made my face pale. An I.V. drip. ""Mon dieu..."" A hand flew to my mouth, and I stumbled back until my back hit the rusted door. Italy tried to open the door Switzerland went through, but almost screamed from frustration when he found it locked, ""Feli... Feli stop."" I got it now. Why Switzerland was so hesitant to talk about Germany. Why Germany was stuck in Berlin, despite the infestation of the French Empire. ""Fammi entrare! Germania! Germania! Svizzera, aprire ques-!"" I ran to Italy and pulled him away from the door before he could pound on it anymore. At this point, I didn""t know how far we were underground or how much rubble was above us, or where French troops may be hiding. The noise Italy was making would not help keep us hidden, and if I was right... I needed to prepare Italy. ""Seyche, let me go!"" Italy yelled, pulling against me. He was stronger than I, but I had to get him to stop freaking out, or he would only get worse when we saw Germany. ""Feliciano Vargas!"" He froze when I used his full human name, ""I need you to listen. I th-think... I think Ludwig might-"" The door opened just a crack, and Switzerland stuck his head into the room. I couldn""t see passed him to confirm my suspicions, but the look on his face was grim, ""Deutschland""s avake. Just keep your voice down, Italien, and do not..."" He looked away from us and grimaced, ""Just be careful around him."" Italy grew still, and gulped noisily. I looked up at him to see his face gone completely white. He was beginning to put the pieces together... and the picture wasn""t very pretty. Shaking like a leaf, Italy pulled away from me and we walked across the tiny room to the door. He and Switzerland exchanged a long look before the blonde slowly opened the door and moved out of the way. My eyes widened, and I gasped, both hands flying to my mouth. Italy managed three of four steps into the room before his knees gave out. The room was barely bigger than the last one, with another sewer grate in one corner. There were only a few crates in here, and what room there was was cluttered with old medical equipment probably salvaged from the remains of the nearest hospital. In a torn up old chair at one end of the room was a disheveled Austria, clad in an old, torn military uniform much like Switzerland""s and wearing glasses that were broken and patched up in several places. His expression was worn and tired, and he fixed Italy with a stare akin to pity. There was an old bed in the back center of the room with an I.V. filled with clear liquid next to it and various bloodied bandages and looted medications surrounding the room around it. I could smell the pungent scent of medical-grade alcohol and the only light in the room came from a great number of candles. Most of the room was just as worn and broken as the one we left, but none of it could compare to the state of the one in bed.",748687
1263,"His mother before she died had told him stories about love and loss, he had never thought he would feel that. That pain first came with Citra and now with her. He hated himself for it, his mother, but he couldn""t explain why he didn""t hate her. He pulled into the shore near the boats, two to be exact and one of which was reading right beside the one they had taken from his mini isle. Benny was sitting down on its edge staring out into the sunset, his back turned to the jeep. That angered him even more... The thought that another man even bothered with his Luna. He wished right then and there that he had never met her, it would save him from this grief. That he would have to let her go or otherwise face the punishment, her death. BUT WHY DID IT BOTHER HIM?! Vaas grumbled something incoherent to himself as he approached Benny, who at the sound of his footsteps glanced in his direction. ""Where is Luna?"" Vaas placed his hands on his hips and blankly stared out into the sunset. The orange illuminating the masculine features that made up his character. ""She... Um... I let her go."" Vaas mumbled, itching his forehead with a short pause to himself. ""Why did you let her go?"" Benny asked plainly, Vaas shrugged. ""She didn""t seem worth the struggle."" Benny snorted even if Vaas wasn""t joking. ""She is a pain in the ass, isn""t she? I love that about her. She always-"" ""That""s fucking it punto. You""re gonna make me throw the fuck up with that lovey dovey shit. Why are you here?"" Vaas snapped out, not wanting to hear how amazing she was, not wanting to hear anything about her. ""It""s Hoyt. Says he is coming to the island tomorrow for an inspection on the drug fields and some of the villages around here."" Vaas slapped a hand on his forehead and groaned. ""F~Fuck me."" Vaas licked his lips, before his hand dropped. ""I thought he was here just a couple days ago man. He never comes twice a week."" ""Well. He is coming. Thank god Luna is out of the-"" ""Shut the fuck up about that bitch. Nobody gives a fuck."" Vaas gave a fuck... He for some reason gave a lot of fucks about Lunetta, La Luna de Sangre. Benny put his hands up in defense. ""Alright... Sorry."" His eyebrows furrowed a thought came to mind, before quickly being pushed aside. Vaas gestured to the silhouette of the island in the distance, sun sinking behind it. ""We gonna fucking go or what?"" Benny nodded, for some reason he felt that Vaas wasn""t giving the full picture on why Lunetta wasn""t around and it worried him. There was nothing more he could do though, the moon was gone for the month and the sun was dull. The night would be empty for the next week and that scared Benny the most. The dirt stuck to her feet and it was five minutes from five where she stood at the location the man in white named off. She was cautious, she didn""t trust many people and felt that doing this was a huge mistake on her part. Curious overruled that fear however and she felt the need to know more about the things that had been going on lately. About Hoyt, about how this man supposedly knew everything about her.",6234395
2330,"She kept the trance, so he took her arm. ""Callie, let""s go, give these two some space."" She looked at him now, though it took a few moments for her eyes to focus. ""What? I""m far too drunk to drive."" He began pulling her up and walking her to his truck. ""I""m not. I""ll give you a ride back to the hospital."" She frowned at her car, which had made him chuckle when he first pulled up. ""But my car..."" Owen opened the passenger door. ""I""ll be nice and give you a ride again tomorrow when you""re sober and you can pick it up."" He helped her into the truck like a true gentleman and she smiled at him. ""No wonder Yang""s sleeping with you."" Owen sighed. He tried to explain why he was naked in Cristina""s bed that morning without revealing any details, but it was useless. He closed her door and walked to the driver""s street. ""Bailey is looking at us."" Callie leaned in closer to the glass, trying to get a better look. ""Do you think that is a glare? I think she""s pissed."" ""I""m not looking at Bailey."" Callie glanced over at Owen, and it was true. His eyes were trained only on Cristina. If it hadn""t been for the booze, Callie might have been able to repress the eye roll, but really she should""ve known, it was nothing new. She looked at Bailey again. Bailey""s attention was no longer on the gallery; she was looking at Cristina with an unreadable look on her face. Alex looked like someone had just told him his favorite puppy hadn""t gone to a special puppy farm after all. Callie wondered what was going on down there. She wasn""t used to this perspective when it came to surgery. She felt like a spectator at a sporting event. As the surgery continued Callie began to grow bored. Why were they here? Cristina was rocking it out. Of course she was, she was Cristina freaking Yang. Her first solo surgery could""ve been nothing but a success. Callie knew it. Cristina knew it. Owen knew it. Everyone knew it. So, Callie did the same thing she did when she got bored at a sporting event. She rose from the seat she""d taken and began cheering and shouting. ""Go Cristina! Woah! Rock it out, Yang!"" Owen wasn""t watching Cristina anymore. He was trying to quiet Callie and to get her to sit back down again. Callie caught sight of Bailey""s eyes; she was definitely glaring now. A/N: So, haven""t written one of these in awhile (or much of anything really) mostly due to the fact that I""ve been displeased with the direction of the show in recent seasons.

He tried not to think about how Mark began to die while he was stealing his daughter for him. He tried not to think about how he hadn""t had a chance to take him up on his last piece of advice. He tried not to think about April leaving without ever knowing... Avery also didn""t like to think about the night before the boards, partly because it also caused him to need some ""alone time,' but mostly because it just reminded of how badly he""d messed everything up.",1497577
3371,"Joker went on about his false child hood, how it was terrible, and how he had become what he was now. She fell for it, she fell for him. He would make a joke every so often and she would giggle, he liked listening to her giggle so he made as many jokes as he could. Most people wouldn""t laugh, but she having the sick sense of hummer, she did. In the end, she felt pity for him, she wanted to make him better and was convinced that he wanted the same. It was the Batman, he did this to him, and she hated him for it. It was midnight when suddenly she was getting tired. ""I love listening to your Voice Joker. It""s so husky and dominant."" ""Really? Well I love listening to your voice. It""s so melodic and soft."" She blushed at the comment, giggling again. ""I""m getting tired you know, but I don""t want to hang up."" ""Then don""t. Carry yourself to bed and leave the phone next to you. Who knows you might even get a surprise."" ""Why? So you could be creepy and hear my snoring? And What Exactly is this Surprise?"" She jested, standing up and migrating into her room. ""I""m sure your snoring sounds beautiful. Just lay down and I""ll be there in a minute."" ""What?"" He hung up when she was at the frame to her bedroom. A knock came at her door, she dropped the phone, looking down at her inappropriate attire. She rushed into her room, looking for her silk robe, but couldn""t find it. The knocking grew more insistent and she gave up, running to the door and opening it without second thought. She stilled at the sight of the Joker standing at her door, two goons standing on either side of him. He smiled at her with a shrug, stepping into the apartment and closing the door. He was so much taller than her, about one foot would be a probable estimation. ""You locked the door so I couldn""t get in."" He complained playfully, wrapping an arm around her waist and pulling her to him in a frolic type of manner. ""I like your underwear. It suits your personality."" Her lips kept parting and shutting, she didn""t know what to say, she didn""t know how to react, or tell him to get out. Honestly she was scared at what he could do, more than what he was... Insane. ""W-What are you doing here?"" She mumbled, her eyes wide with surprise. He caressed her hips, getting a good look at her, yet again. He assumed she wouldn""t last long. He would find interest in her and give up sooner, or later, then she would have to die. ""Oh yes... You""ll do fine."" He made a comical whistle, taking a step back and looking you up and down. ""What do you mean?"" ""I want you to help me kill the Batman. You work for Falcony anyways, it can""t be that much of a difference."" He walked over to the fudge and began rummaging through it, then looking through every cabinet he could see. She stepped over to the counter and leaned against it watching him shyly. The Joker was in her apartment and she didn""t know what to say. He turned to her pointedly, raising his hands. ""Do you have any booze around here?"" ""I-I don""t drink."" ""Hmm... Pity.""",6234395

But the underworld has learned the news as well, and soon Clark receives the first threats. Clark""s family, as well as his friends and colleagues at the ""Planet,"" are suddenly in constant danger of being used as a means of exerting pressure on Clark. Fortunately, H. G. Wells has kept up with the latest developments. Once again he comes from the future in order to help Clark against Moirag and the inhabitants of Metropolis. Together they find that the world is not yet ready to know the truth about the Man of Steel... Although Moirag is taken back to her time prison by Clark and H. G. Wells, Clark cannot rest. The underworld of Metropolis is at least as big a pain in the ass as Moirag. A completely unexpected thing in this episode is the reappearance of Tracy ""Cat"" Scoggins, who left the series after the first season.5.21: The Day Before You Came Special guest star: John Shea (Lex Luthor) Lois and Clark""s wedding anniversary is drawing near. Clark has extremely much to do and hardly has any time for his wife. Although Lois can understand him, she feels a little neglected. When she spends an evening all alone with her child at the fireplace, she remembers her life the way it was before she met Clark Kent. She recalls all major events in her life - the birth of her sister Lucy, her parents""s divorce, her first kiss, the prom, her first apartment on her own, her employment at the ""Planet""... but something seems to be missing; the events seem gray and lifeless to her. Lois recalls her past relationships - Patrick Sullvian, Claude, and of course Lex Luthor. But in the end she realizes that her life did not make any real sense until the day she met Clark Kent and fell in love with him. Lois thinks of the dreams and plans she used to have. Everything turned out differently than she had planned, and still her life couldn""t be any richer. Clark and her child, her friends, her work - all those memories have nothing gray or lifeless about them... So shortly before the end of the season, the producers have a surprise in store. This episode may very well be the one with the least action ever produced. It fully relies on Teri Hatcher, who can pull out all the stops here and show her true acting skills. We meet Lex Luthor, Patrick Sullivan (from ""When Irish Eyes Are Killing""), Lois""s parents, Sam and Ellen, and many more. The backflashes without Clark were digitally reworked, so that they seem paler and with less color; in the scene where Clark appears for the first time, the viewer is practically overwhelmed by the intense colors. Much footage from older episodes was used once again in this one. The title of this episode reminds of the ABBA song of the same name.5.22: Not Only Angels Fly Special guest star: Tracy Scoggins (Cat Grant) Dr. Klein summons Lois and Clark to meet him in order to talk about their child.",240213
3200,"She always said hello when we met, and sometimes we""d talk for a little while."" ""Did you find her attractive?"" Dylan laughed. ""Detective, I was twenty years old,"" he said. ""The only girls I saw regularly were Jordan and my sister. I""d probably have found any girl attractive, just because I really needed a change. But Natalya really was attractive. She had those wonderful eyes, like a doe, and her hair was soft. And the greatest thing was that she wasn""t arrogant or anything. At least not more than Jordan or Sunny. Well, Sunny was still a child,"" he amended. ""But unfortunately, Natalya never fancied me. She preferred someone else, if you take my meaning."" ""Jamie Jarvis."" It wasn""t a question. Dylan nodded. ""Sunday still insists that this was only a rumor, and that there was nothing between Jamie and Natalya, but frankly, I don""t know why she denies it so vehemently. I mean, it was pretty obvious. Jamie was twenty-four years old, very good-looking, and very mature for his age. It was only natural that she felt attracted by him. And moreover, Gabe and Graham and I, we were all younger than her."" ""You think that would have been a problem?"" ""Most women like older men,"" said Dylan with a shrug. ""Don""t you, Detective Rush?"" Lilly was a little taken aback, but she did not hold it against Dylan. ""Depends,"" she said evasively. ""Your sister described Natalya as scheming and men-crazy,"" Chris remarked. ""That doesn""t seem to fit your description of her."" ""Did Sunny really say that?"" Dylan shook his head in surprise. ""I didn""t have the impression that she was always chasing after the men. She hardly ever went out, and I can""t remember that she ever tried to make a pass at me or Graham."" ""Your sister said she did."" ""Sunny must""ve mixed things up,"" Dylan said determinedly. ""Or maybe she really thought so. I mean, she was only thirteen years old. Maybe she thought a smile was an unmistakable signal."" ""She didn""t seem to be mixing things up. She said Natalya was trying all of you, but you never reacted."" Dylan sneered. ""It was more the other way around,"" he said. ""She turned her back on us. But in a friendly way,"" he added hastily. ""She just made us understand that she already had her eyes set on someone else."" ""What about the other thing your sister said? That Natalya was scheming?"" ""Scheming... well, I thought until yesterday that she made for the hills with the car and the money, so I thought of course she was scheming - in retrospect, I mean. But apart from that, I never had the impression of her being such a bitch. And if it""s really her out there, then I suppose she was a poor thing rather than a scheming monster."" ""What can you tell us about Jamie? Why did he leave?"" ""No one knows."" Lilly had expected this answer. ""He just left."" ""Any guesses?"" ""Chasing after his lover? Chasing butterflies?"" Dylan shrugged. ""I really don""t know, Detective."" Lilly sighed and focused on another question. ""Can you tell us anything in general about Jamie?"" she asked. ""What kind of guy was he?"" ""He was the coolest,"" said Dylan with warmth.",240213

""Then here we come"" ""Ned she is sure indecisive isn""t she?"" Ned nodded his head rubbing his orange eyebrows finishing up the packing. ""But I can""t deny that I""m not happy she decided to go back on tour. I guess this staying home and being normal thing is not for me"" ""Any of us"" Irene pulled her hair back and started to charge her cell phone batteries. She stopped using her cell phone when they quit the tour because there was no reason to use it but now there was. ""This will be an adventure, especially with Fi being back"" ""Life will be weird"" Irene and Ned laughed and walked outside where the MP tour bus was parked. Jack finished his packing and motioned for his sister and Annie to come outside. ""Hurry up you two!"" Annie and Fi laughed and grabbed their suitcases and followed Jack outside. Fi stared at the MP tour bus and smiled to herself; she missed the sight of that bus. ""Weird huh?"" Annie nodded and thought about all the adventures that were to come. Jack put down his bag and walked over to Fi and put his arm around her neck. ""Guess some things never change huh?"" Fi nodded and held on to her brother. ""Except that we have Annie on the tour now."" Jack frowned. ""If you two give me any trouble"" Annie walked behind Jack and smiled at Fi and they both gave Jack their best innocent faces. ""Who us?"" Jack shrugged his head and waved his hand when he saw Carey walk outside and over to the bus. ""Weird huh Jack? Back on the tour"" Jack nodded and helped Carey put his stuff on the bus. ""Well at least you get to play music again. Excited about that?""",29783
3336,"A group of lunatics thought the other side of the gate was a mythical land of peace and prosperity...If only they""d known it was as imperfect as this one. ""Oh, that""s fine...Russel""s just keen on flying and the possibility of space travel,"" she said as she fluffed the pillows. Ed nodded, then looked around the room. On a desk, he saw a photo, and recognized Winry""s parents...Even they were the same. Odd. He picked it up, then smiled. Winry was a cute kid...To think instead of him and Al this one had grown up with the Tringams. ""Are these your parents?"" he asked, even though he didn""t have to. Winry stood up and came over, then looked over his shoulder. She leaned on his back, one arm on his sholder. He bit his lip...He could feel her chest pressed to his back. What was wrong with him? He never noticed things like that before. ""Yes,"" she said, her mouth by his ear. ""My mother died when I was still small...about a year after this was taken...My dad died a few years ago, during the war. He was a doctor, but he loved his work, and died doing it,"" she said. ""He and doctor Marshal, our local doctor in town, worked together a lot... but before all that, Dad had been the one who taught me about mechanics and such."" ""I""m sorry you lost them,"" Ed said, remembering the Rockbells. ""I""m sure they were wonderful people... But why are you so familiar with the church?"" he asked. ""Oh, well, I""ve spent a lot of time alone, and I go down so often its really like a second home."" she giggled, blowing breath against his cheek, ""A few people in the village actually call me ""Sister Winifred""...But I could never be a nun."" ""Oh, that""s good,"" Ed said, relieved, then he blushed, backed up, and looked at her, ""I mean...um...I mean, that""s good, because...Because you really should meet a nice guy and settle down, not be stuck in a church all the time- Not that there""s anything wrong with that!"" he added, waving his hands, and the picture still in one. ""Its just...From what I""ve seen, it might not be for you."" Why don""t I shut up already?! Winry""s face had been red the entire time, but now she laughed, ""Its alright... I""m still oung, I have plenty of time to think about it."" ""I agree with Edward,"" Russel said from the doorway. Ed and Winry both looked over. Ed frowned, and inwardly was ticked. That jerk had spied on them! He""d probably been there the whole time, listening in! ""How long were you there?"" ""Just enough to hear your comment, but like I said, I agree,"" then he walked in, and stood in front of Winry, ""I just wanted to say goodnight, Wnry, before me and Fletcher go back to the old house....And I wanted to say it was nice meeting you, Mr. Elric, and invite you and Alphonse and Miss Noah to stay with us after tomorrow...Fletcher and Al seem to get along, and Winry""s home is too small for four people, after all, and Al""s already accepted..."" Ed glared at him, then said, ""Oh?...That so..."" he looked from Winry to Russel...He wished Al hadn""t said yes already. But, it was better to act civil. Ed came over, and gave Russel his hand again.",512464
1647,"Instead, he turned suddenly, pushing Satine behind him, so her back pressed against the wall that surrounded the town. He stood between her and the ever-growing throng people that surrounded them. Now would be a good time to have a lightsaber, he thought wryly. Although for the most part, the townspeople appeared to be nothing more than simple villagers, he had learned long ago that you could never count out a Mandalorian regardless of their station. Almost all had been trained in combat since birth, meaning a farmer could be just as deadly as an assassin or bounty hunter, and more than a match for an unarmed jedi padawan and a pacifist duchess. The crowd was pressing in on them, led by the man who had first recognized Satine. ""We live in hell, mhi cuye o""r dar""yaim, while this hut""uunla Duchess, this dar""manda, runs away and conspires with the Jetiise!"" ""Stay back,"" Obi-Wan warned. The crowd didn""t listen, just pressed forward. He took a step backwards. ""I say we give her over to the bounty hunters-split the reward,"" the second man added. ""Gra""tua par Mandalore!"" Soon the cry carried through the crowd. ""Gra""tua par Mandalore! Gra""tua par Mandalore!"" ""I""m guessing they""re not surrendering,"" Obi-Wan whispered drily to Satine, taking another step back, so he was practically on top of her. With no more room for him to retreat, the crowd finally halted. They were completely surrounded-if he reached out a hand, he could practically brush the chest of the leader. Satine didn""t respond; she was too busy staring into the mob. Obi-Wan followed her gaze, and saw that the old woman from the booth had joined the crowd. Though he wasn""t exactly surprised, he could practically feel the sadness and weariness rolling off the Duchess. ""Don""t come any closer,"" Obi-Wan said, addressing the man in front in particular. ""I don""t want to hurt you."" The man laughed derisively. ""Arrogant little Jetii."" He took a step forward, so he and Obi-Wan were mere inches apart. ""I will crush you."" The man raised his fists and Obi-Wan raised his own hands, ready to force-push him back. ""STOP!"" Ridiculously, Satine""s cry was so unexpected it actually worked-both Obi-Wan and the man turned to her in surprise. Before he was completely cognizant of what was happening, she had slipped under Obi-Wan""s raised arms and pushed him back, so he was pressed against the wall and she stood unprotected before the mob of angry Mandalorians. His shock was matched by the man he had been about to fight, who, somewhat ironically, looked unsure of how to proceed, now that the exact thing he wanted was standing before him. The Duchess however exhibited none of his hesitation. Looking to the crowd, she calmly removed her hood. ""I am Satine Kryze of Clan Kryze, Duchess of Mandalore."" She paused a moment before continuing. ""I beg you to let us go without violence."" ""What are you doing?"" Obi-Wan whispered fiercely, trying to maneuver around her. She pushed him back with surprising force. ""Let me handle this, Obi,"" she whispered back. ""Not all of us have forgotten our heritage.""",2943978

1175,"Stella added to her husband. ""Well, I hope you like meatloaf, Marty and Anne..."" ""Anne? Who""s-?"" ""Well, that""s your sister, isn""t it? Anne Klein?"" Stella raised her eyebrows. Marty looked at Elle. Elle looked at Marty. She shrugged. ""Yeah. That""s us,"" he said, putting an arm around her. ""Calvin and Anne Klein."" ""Oh, ho, ho! Look at it roll!"" Sam hooted triumphantly, wheeling in the TV he had been messing with. ""Now we can watch Jackie Gleason while we eat."" The rest of the family fixed their attention on the TV, but Lorraine kept her eyes on Marty. ""Our first television set,"" she said shyly. ""Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television?"" ""Well, yeah, you know, we have... two of them."" ""Wow!"" said one of the little boys. ""You must be rich!"" ""Oh, honey, he""s teasing you, nobody has two television sets,"" Stella said good-naturedly. Silence descended on the table once more as everyone returned their attention to the TV. In flickering black-and-white, a man appeared through a doorway, covered head to toe in aluminum foil and cardboard boxes. A metal pot sat on his head in a comical way. Elle nearly choked on her potatoes. ""Hey. Hey, I""ve seen this one, this is a classic!"" she blurted. ""This is where Ralph dresses up as a man from space!"" ""What do you mean you""ve seen this?"" the boy said. ""It""s brand-new."" ""Yeah, well, er, I saw it on a... rerun,"" Elle said, remembering where she was. The boy stared at her. ""What""s a rerun?"" Elle looked away. ""You""ll find out..."" she mumbled, feeling her face heating up. Stella propped her head in her hand thoughtfully. ""You know, you look so familiar. Do I know your mother?"" Marty took a fearful glance at the teenaged Lorraine beside him. ""Yeah, I think maybe you do."" ""Well, I want to give your mother a call. I don""t want her to worry about you guys."" ""You can""t,"" Marty blurted. ""That is, uh, nobody""s- nobody""s home."" ""Oh."" ""Yet,"" he added, in case she got the wrong idea. ""Oh,"" she said again. ""Uh, listen, to you know where Riverside Drive is?"" Elle jumped in, rescuing him. ""That""s on the other side of town, a block past Maple,"" Sam said, not looking away from the TV. ""East end of town."" ""A block past Maple, that""s John F. Kennedy Drive,"" Elle worked out the directions out loud. Sam tore his eyes away from the TV to look at her. ""Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?"" ""Um, mother?"" Lorraine said, her voice high-pitched and innocent-sounding. ""With their parents out of town, don""t you think they oughta spend the night? After all, Dad almost killed Marty with the car."" ""That""s true, guys,"" Stella said. ""I think you should spend the night, I think you""re our responsibility."" ""Gee, thanks, Mrs. Baines..."" ""I mean, I don""t know...""

""Marty, what happened? You just shot up and left!""",2855986
2600,"Reaching around her back she unclipped her bra, careful not to startle him, she placed it down on the ground removing her panties in suit. He was still content in not opening his eyes, for all she knew this could surprise him. She crawled forward onto the bed, getting closer to him she swung a leg over his waist. The covers keeping them from contact, his eyes shot open and his breath hatched as they traveled down her smooth figure. He grinned as if this was still part of the game. ""I see-"" She placed a finger to his lips before leaning forward and kissing his collarbone, down she went, continuing with kisses of both love and worship. She was now straddling his knees, pulling down the covers his cock popped free. She brought her lips to his, kissing it and nurturing it as if it was the only thing she needed. He groaned every time she would submerge his cock into her mouth and swallow. He never would have guessed she be so good at the task as if she had experience. ""Curious..."" He weaves his fingers through her hair and brings her head up to look at him. ""Where did you learn how to do this so well?"" She blushed of embarrassment, but smile none the less. ""I read a lot of books in the library. Learned many things, even your Asgardian library carries very vigorous love making positions."" ""Really?"" He was breathless and her seduction attempts, extending the tip of her tongue to his head. ""Oh yes, my king. I plan on enjoying this even if it is against my will."" He bellowed laughter, she frowned up at him. ""You are doing this at your own will. Unless you""d not like to have your magic back."" ""No... I would love to have my magic back."" Her voice went low and aroused, but Loki was still not convinced. She had one chance to get her magic back, one chance to prove this was all real, that she wasn""t lying. She was back up to his lips again, kissing him with her lips, but not fully. She sat up straddling his waist, he trailed his hands down her thighs. He could see she was not happy at all with this, but she truly cared for her magic, magic that she undoubtedly would die for. First, she needed to learn a lesson in love, he was her husband, they were married. She had no choice, but to love him with, or without her magic. She undid the back of her bra throwing it to the side of the bed and allowing him to bring his hands from her thighs to her breasts. Squeezing them and gliding his thumbs across her nipples. She clenched her eyes shut and tried not to think of the great pleasure this brought her. ""You are supposed to be enjoying this darling."" ""I-I..."" It didn""t help that his hand had now grabbed the hem of her underwear. ""Take them off. Fuck me like you love me."" The language left his tongue in a foul manner that sent shivers down her body. She couldn""t the last time hearing such words leave his mouth, the F word was something she definitely wasn""t expecting to leave his mouth. She did as he requested, he held his hand out to take the article from her.",6234395
1105,"Satine smiled and thanked the woman graciously, but before they turned away, Obi-Wan saw her slip the rest of the money (and quite possibly a little extra) over the counter, placing it artfully behind a large melon-like fruit. Undoubtedly, the woman would find it when packing up her stall for the night. A small smile spread across Obi-Wan""s cheeks. Satine caught his expression in the corner of her eye, and she pressed a finger to her lips. For a moment, Obi-Wan fancied that she was struggling to keep a smile off her own face. His widened into a grin, and he found all hard feelings from before quite dissolved. Satine""s tongue could be deadly in the midst of an argument, but she forgave quickly, a fact for which he was eternally grateful. With a newfound amicability, he offered the Duchess his arm, and the two proceeded back the way they""d come, towards the desert road. As they approached the edge of the market though, a strong blast of wind again blew Satine""s hood off her head. In a moment, she had returned it to it""s place, but the damage was done. Obi-Wan quickly scanned the area. Satine""s face was well-known throughout the system, both through her role as duchess as well as through the ever-increasing bounty on her head. He hoped that her royal heritage would be obscured by her travel-strained clothes and the general unkempt appearance that goes along with a month of hiding out in caves. Unfortunately, that didn""t seem to be the case. A few feet in front of them, a man who had been leaning casually against the gate that led out of town, perked up, staring at Satine with an ominous interest. ""Hey, don""t I know you from somewhere?"" He asked, moving a couple of steps to block their way. ""I don""t think so,"" Satine mumbled, looking down at the ground. ""I""m sure I""ve seen your face somewhere,"" he continued. ""I""m sorry, sir, you must be mistaken,"" Obi-Wan said, inching closer to Satine, ready to step in front of her if need be. ""She""s the Duchess!"" A second man chimed in, joining the first in front of the exit. ""I don""t know what you""re talking about. We""re just travelers,"" Obi-Wan insisted. The two men ignored his protests. ""I think you""re right!"" The first man said, and reached out a hand to yank down her hood once again. In a flash, Obi-Wan grabbed his wrist. ""I must ask you to step aside."" A small crowd had gathered around them and Obi-Wan heard shapeless murmurs of Mando""a, undoubtedly discussing whether or not Satine was the notorious Duchess of Mandalore. More men came to stand beside the first two, neatly blocking any chance for a quick escape. Obi-Wan""s heart sank. Nothing on Mandalore was to be easy, it seemed. ""If she""s the Duchess, that makes you an aruetii, a Jetii."" The man wrenched his arm free from Obi-Wan""s grasp. Jetii was clear enough, and although Obi-Wan had no idea what aruetii might mean, from the man""s derisive tone he assumed it was far from complimentary. He thought about denying it, but really they were beyond the point where denial could be helpful.",2943978
371,"Michael beat me so badly that I bled. I bled a lot."" I raised Jaehee""s shirt a bit to show the long scar on my stomach, ""Michael took me out of the basement for the first time. I couldn""t say anything to the doctor, though I think he suspected even though Michael played the part of the panicked fiancee perfectly. I couldn""t say anything because I was so scared."" I tried to keep going, but the memory of it... the doctor""s face when he told Michael and I, all of it... it was too much. It was all too much. The tears spilled over, staining the old slightly fuzzy fabric of the couch. I covered my mouth with a fist to contain my sobs. ""Aya..."" I felt, rather than saw, him reach for me. ""No, no no... no,"" I scooted away, holding my hands up, palms forward, to stop him. I sobbed again and covered my mouth, ""I can do this. I can do this."" He didn""t say anything, but after a few long, tense minutes Zen asked after thickly swallowing, ""How did you escape?"" I could tell he didn""t want to ask, not really. But the questioning was what I needed to finish the story. There was something more detached about answering questions, ""His beating caused a miscarriage. Michael took me home and caged me, but he was different."" I winced, remembering how, after so long in captivity, I""d felt so sorry for him then, ""He was... sad. He told me he""d wanted the baby as much as I did, so we could... could be a family."" I gave a hollow laugh, ""Family... but when he threw me back in the cage, in his depressed state, he forgot to lock the cage door. I waited four hours, forty-two minutes, and thirteen seconds to escape. I knew because of the digital clock in my cell."" I ran the hand on my mouth over my face, peering through my fingers at the television, ""I snuck out of the mansion, then broke into a run through the estate grounds. I don""t know how I managed it, but I got to the neighbors and they called the police. I was taken to the hospital, his mansion was raided and Michael arrested, and with Derek""s testimony and all the other evidence, Michael was given life in prison without the possibility of parole. I spent a year between in-patient and out-patient care for my injuries and... psychiatric care."" I didn""t tell him about the trial. About being forced to relive it all over and over again, how his high-powered lawyers tried over and over to assassinate my character and make me out as a harlot. He didn""t need to know about all that. I clicked my tongue, hands dropping to my lap, and I smiled, ""And that""s my story."" When an eternity passed in silence, I finally turned to look at Zen. My eyes widened, jaw agape, when I saw his tears. Why? Why was he crying? Before I could think, I reached for him, one shaky hand on his shoulder and the over cupping his cheek to wipe away the tears. ""Please... don""t cry for me. It was a long time ago."" He shook his head, eyes shut tight. His teeth were clenched, as were his hands, and I could feel his trembling underneath my hands, ""I... I-I..."" Zen moved away quickly, startling me away.",748687
2299,"""Why not?"" ""Well I want to surprise everybody"" ""And what a surprise it will be"" Steve and Brenda stared back at Dylan as he walked into the Peach Pit. Dylan walked past Donna and sat down, David sat down next to Dylan and stared at him. ""What David?"" ""So what happened between you and Gina?"" ""You""ll see"" With that they both were quiet. ""So Steve what took you so long? You were supposed to be here an hour ago"" Steve turned around and stared back at Kelly and smiled. ""Well someone kept us"" ""Who?"" This time it was Donna who asked the question. Steve plastered this huge grin on his already glowing face. Donna and Kelly turned to each and exchanged stares. ""What""s with him?"" ""I have no idea Kel"" ""Well....."" Everybody turned to see Steve stand up. ""Well what?"" a very confused David asked. Steve laughed and jumped up on the counter quickly kicking his feet all around dancing back and forth. ""Get the heck off my counter Steve! What in the world has gotten in you? In all of the years that I have known you I""ve never seen you act like this"" Nat asked in a very quizzical voice. ""Well Nat to answer your earlier question... I""m Crazy!!!!! Ask my dear friend Kelly Taylor"" Nat turned to Kelly. ""He""s crazy, actually he""s a maniac"" ""Well thank you Kelly for that. So all you are probably wondering why I""m acting like a crazy nut right?"" ""Right"" Kelly and Donna said at the same time. ""Well today when I went to Dylan""s to see if he was game to coming to the Peach Pit I got an unexpected visitor. Well I am here right now to present her to you, are you guys ready?"" Everybody in the Peach Pit yelled yes. ""Okay! So I, Steve Sanders, am proud to present the beautiful, the funny, the cool... Brenda Walsh!"" With that Brenda walked out from the kitchen to face the people she hadn""t seen in seven years. ""Oh my god!"" Was all Donna could say, meanwhile Kelly said nothing but just sat there in shock at what she was seeing. David smiled and nudged Dylan in the ribs and Nat just stood there with a huge grin on his face. Donna got up from the chair that she was seated in and hugged Brenda like there was no tomorrow. ""Oh my god, I can""t believe that you""re here. When we talked I never thought that you would come"" ""Well here I am"" She hugged Donna and smiled. ""Well hey you"" ""Well hey you too, long time no see David"" Brenda and David hugged and exchanged glances. ""Hi Brenda"" Brenda turned around to see Kelly staring at her. Every nerve in her body felt like it was on fire, she felt her blood become more hotter and her heart began to beat faster. Here was what she was waiting for... the final confrontation between her and Kelly. ""Yea hi"" Kelly felt her heart break, she desperately thought that their friendship meant more then just a ""yea hi"" she was hurt and Brenda didn""t care. Gina who was viewing this heart-wrenching thing smiled at the face that Kelly was wearing, those two words had turned Kelly into a sappy puppy dog who like she was about to cry and Gina loved it. ""Oh!"" Brenda and the gang turned around to see Donna jumping up and down in excitement. ""What Don?""",29783
500,"She seriously considered running out and away, pretending this night never existed. She""d be happy to return to the days when she didn""t know Batman and Bruce were the same person. As for Alfred, she was sure a villainess of her caliber could find a way to keep him quiet. But it was simply too late. She gathered herself and replied simply, ""Thank you."" Alfred walked out of her view. Selina spent a few more moments studying her cat costume in the glass case. What was to become of Catwoman? She went to Bruce, Batman. Bruce""s return to the world was a hazy experience; he felt a light touch caressing his cheek and without thinking said, ""Talia."" Unknown to him, Selina stopped caressing his cheek, and whispered, ""Bruce?"" He answered, ""Rachel."" She nodded and dropped her hand; swallowing the hurt and reclaiming a cool, indifferent look quickly in time for his eyes to open. Bruce observed Selina on his bed, but before he could say her name noticed she was unmasked but still in costume. He then immediately noticed he was in the Batcave, in his costume. His eyes narrowed, ""What are you doing here?"" She smirked, a naughty twinkle in her eye, it was even more effective without the mask, ""Making sure you got home safe and sound, stud. You took quite a beating."" Bruce shot up, though his body protested immediately and he leaned back slightly to satisfy its wishes. He spoke in his Bat growl, ""You shouldn""t be here, Catwoman."" Selina stiffened and matched his glare, ""That scary growl of yours has never worked on me, Batman."" Bruce didn""t like this; he was completely unprepared for this situation. Yes, he was prepared for a villain in the Batcave and even discovering his secret identity, but said villain wasn""t supposed to be holding his hand while he recovered. He""d always struggled to deal with Catwoman, Selina, effectively, but that had to stop. He couldn""t let his emotions master him. ""What game are you playing?"" Selina rose from the bed, ""This isn""t a fucking rooftop, Bruce. Stop treating it as such."" Bruce replied, ""You""re Catwoman, Selina. How am I not supposed to treat this as a threat?"" Selina gave a throaty laugh, ""I""m a threat to you? I may be a thief, but I""ve never been a true threat."" The detective in him felt complied to supply evidence, ""You""ve thrown me off buildings and moving vehicles, drugged me, electrocuted me, led me into some Godforsaken death trap, slashed me with those damned claws of yours, do I really need to keep going?"" ""You""re the Goddamn Batman. All that shit""s ever going to do is slow you down."" Bruce answered quietly, ""I""ll have you arrested, expose you."" Selina shot back, ""And what""s to stop me from exposing you in return? No honor among thieves and all that."" Bruce smirked as though she""d proven his point and replied evenly, ""I""m no thief."" She remarked, ""But you don""t operate within the confines of the law either, Batman."" Bruce laid back and turned his head away from her, ""Get out."" Selina raised a hand and looked like she was going to argue with him, but changed her mind and instead said, ""Fine.""",1497577
2575,"I hope you enjoyed what you""ve read these past 31 days :D This is the first time I tried writing a story using prompts and it has been challenging but very fun! Unfortunately, this is my last project as I will finally be retiring from fanfiction writing after being in the site for ten years already. I will be busier with Medical School starting this August and I""m afraid I will have little to no time to write. That being said, I will not stop being a SasuSaku fan however, and will continue to support SS stories when I have time to read. Thank you, thank you so much for being with me as I finish this. I am forever grateful. :D ~Miriae P.S. Shameless plug: Hope you can also check out my other SasuSaku story, entitled Years, Decades, Centuries Happy Day 4 everyone! :D Prompt 4: There Was No Warning It was a hot day in the training grounds and Sasuke sat leaning against a tree, one knee folded against his chest, an arm slung over his eyes, shielding himself from the glare. He was slowly drifting into a light slumber when he felt the air suddenly shift. There was no warning as a sharp object grazed his peripheral vision and hastily he jumped, swinging himself up the branch. Narrowing his eyes, he raised an eyebrow at his intruder. Sakura looked up at him with a smile as she raised the pair of scissors on her right hand. ""Very good reflexes, Sasuke-kun. Now, why don""t you come down?"" A suspicious look crossed his face as he eyed the scissors warily. ""And why would I do that?"" She pursued her lips, ""Because I said so, Sasuke-kun."" ""Hn."" But he did not move. ""Sasuke!"" she laughed lightly as she waved the scissors in her hand. ""I""m just going to cut your hair! It has gone unbelievably rowdy!"" ""Rowdy,"" he echoed flatly as he jumped down to sit in front of her. Her smile brightened as she knelt next to him and covered his shoulders with a white cloth. Carefully, she undid his forehead protector and fingered his black hair. She hummed lightly as she made the first snip. ""Your hair has grown over your eyes. Doesn""t it bother you?"" Not really. He didn""t bother with such trivial things. ""No."" She continued cutting his hair, humming as she went, and he closed his eyes, enjoying the quiet it brought. ""There,"" she announced as she leaned back. ""Done!"" He ran his fingers through the shorter strands and grunted in approval. Sakura replaced the forehead protector on his head and tapped the Konoha leaf symbol visible between his center parted bangs. She smiled wistfully . ""I like it this way. Cleaner-very much like Sasuke-kun."" And when he looked at his reflection mirrored in her green eyes, he managed a small smile. She had just recreated his twelve year old self""s hairstyle. I miss Part 1 Sasuke""s cleaner look. Right now, he looks too Emo for me. Thank you and please do review! Happy Day 5 everyone! :D Prompt 5: Keepsake Ino""s eyes were wide, her nose pressed against the glass as she stared hungrily at the beautiful golden ring adorned with princess-cut diamonds.

3180,"Pike chuckled. ""I""m glad to see you came, Jim. Even if you are late."" Kirk didn""t seem phased in the least, and hurriedly followed as Pike motioned them to come in. Standing in the doorway of what could only be called a foyer, Bones sized the man up. So this was Christopher Pike. Well. At least he seemed more hygienic than some other friends of Kirk""s father he had met. ""You must be Dr. McCoy,"" Pike said, reaching out a hand in greeting. ""Jim told me he was bringing you."" Bones shook it. "" And you must be Christopher Pike."" He hesitated a second before continuing. ""I""m a little surprised to see your place. Doesn""t seem like someone who already has money would take the risk of robbing a bank just to get more."" It may not have been the smartest move to just lay his concerns out on the table, but Bones had never exactly been one for subtlety or mind games. Pike smiled. ""An astute observation, Doctor. For now let""s just say that money isn""t my only concern in this job."" Bones was surprised that the man had admitted to that much, but he decided to drop his questioning. For then at least. ""So, Pike,"" Kirk said, getting back in on the conversation. ""About this team you mentioned..."" ""They""re waiting in the parlor."" Parlor. God this place made Bones uncomfortable. The journey to said parlor did little to put but Bones"" mind at ease. Kirk and Pike were engaged in a conversation and talking animatedly, while he was left to brood about the consequences that would undoubtedly come when they reached the parlor and an entire police squadron was set up to arrest them. To his enormous relief, his fears remained unconfirmed as Pike swung the massive and unnecessarily fancy doors open and there was only a scattering of occupants, none of whom looked particularly intimidating or police-esque. ""Everyone this is James Kirk and Dr. Leonard McCoy. They-"" Before Pike could finish his sentence, a woman walked up to Kirk. Bones felt a sinking feeling as he recognized her chocolate skin and the long black hair pulled into a high ponytail on the top of her head. ""Uhura! It""s so good to see-"" Kirk was interrupted as a slap resonated through the room. ""I see you two have met,"" Pike commented drily, looking from the fuming woman to the man currently clutching his cheek. ""What-"" Once again Kirk was interrupted. ""That was for Gaila."" Uhura""s glare was terrifying. ""We run in some of the same circles,"" Bones leaned over and whispered to Pike. ""Ah."" The older man nodded in understanding. ""That""s not a surprise."" Uhura tore her murderous gaze from Kirk. With a flip of her ponytail she turned towards Bones and offered her hand. ""Dr. McCoy. It""s always a pleasure."" ""Likewise,"" Bones said, trying to keep from laughing. ""What, you don""t slap Bones?"" Kirk muttered, looking utterly offended ""Dr. McCoy didn""t sleep with my best friend and never call her again!"" Uhura shouted, once again whirling on Kirk. He shrunk back, afraid of her wrath, and this time Bones couldn""t stop the chuckle from escaping.",2943978
2178,"""Good boy,"" Serenity said, ""Here,"" she gave him a pack of hot Ramen, which he greedily consumed on the spot. Then, the woman crying on the floor got a idea. She stood, and walked hurriedly over to a table, and picked up a stick. ""My lover""s reputation, and my dignity, shall be avenged,"" she said. She opened a window, and threw the stick out, yelling, ""Fetch, boy!!!!"" Inu-yasha lifted his head, dropped the Ramen, and raced to the window. Before anyone could stop him, he leaped out the window, landed on the ground, and ran out into the rain howling. ""NO!"" Yami cried. He ran to the window, a yelled into the storm, ""Inu-yasha! Come back!"" Serenity and Joegore soon joined the dismayed doctor at the window. ""We must find him, before someone kills him. Oh, God in heaven, what have I done?"" Act Four: Scene Three It was raining, it was cold, and he was utterly lost. Inu-yasha had ducked inside the trunk of an old tree to get out of the rain. He whimpered. He missed his home. He missed Serenity and Joegore and his father. ""Father..."" he whined. ""Serenity... Ramen...."" he missed the food most of all. He was so hungry. He stayed there all day, until the rain stopped at sundown. He poked his head out, then crawled from his hiding place. With a quick shake, he dried himself off, and he walked on, looking for the way home. The night wore on, and the moon rose high and full. Soon, Inu-yasha heard feet crunching on the leaves and twigs on the ground. He ducked behind a tree, and watched as a girl with black hair and a kind face stepped into the thicket. ""Kouga, are you sure this is a short cut?"" the girl asked a young man who appeared behind her. ""Oh, yes,"" Kouga answered, ""A short to love,"" he suddenly grabbed her and started smooching her. She screamed, and said, ""Kouga! I told you not to do that anymore! Remember: No bedding without a wedding!"" ""I""ve waited three years, Kagome,"" Kouga said. ""Three years of your family""s questions, preparations, and of your stubbornness. I admit, it""s a turn on, but I""m tired of waiting,"" he half growled. As a cloud passed by, revealing the full moon, Kouga began to change. Hi ears grew pointier, his blue eyes suddenly became more wild, fur sprouted from his arms and legs. And he grew a tail. Kagome gasped, ""You""re... You""re a.... A Werewolf!"" she cried. Kouga howled, and as Kagome ran off, Kouga chased after her. Inu-yasha, from his hiding place, growled viciously. He wouldn""t let that wolf hurt that poor girl. He tore after both of them, bounding on all fours. Soon, he saw his prey in the darkness... Then, he pounced! Kagome""s feet pounded on the earthy floor as she ran from her fiancé, who was really a Werewolf. She cried with terror. She would die tonight, she knew it! Kouga would rip her to shreds as he took advantage of her. ""Oh, why do these things always happen to me?!"" she cried. Then, she took one false step, twisted her ankle, and tumbled to the ground. She sat up, and saw Kouga closing in on her. She closed her eyes..... There was a howl, and the sound of two beast snarling and growling.",512464
402,"A sickening brown stain was visible on the dirty gray blanket lying bunched up at the end. Ana cringed. She followed the dark smear across the floorboards to the stairs. Which one was it? Never mind...I don""t want to know! She turned away from the ruined bed and began to search through the dresser drawers and closet. She found nothing. The Outsider had vanished. Of course he has... She was about to give up when she tripped. Swearing nastily, she sat up and rubbed her knee. After digging a splinter out of it, she noticed that the floorboard was loose. It took a few minutes to find a fire poker, then another few minutes to force the board up enough where she could get the small metal box underneath. There was a coin pouch there, unsurprisingly empty, and a small journal. She blew the dust off of it and flipped it open to the first page. In just a few short days, Ana will turn seven years old. Then she will be old enough for the Abbey of the Everyman to take her in. As much as I""d rather not do this, I think it""s the only future she""ll have. I can""t bear to have her turn into one of those street-corner prostitutes, nor can I bear to imagine her as a common laborer, heavy with child, unable to get enough to feed herself let alone several more hungry mouths. She is a very outgoing child and her beauty is already starting to show. It won""t be long before the men take notice of her. I know her mother dislikes this idea with a passion-she""s been very vocal about not wanting to send Ana away. But again, we have no choice. The other thing is this imaginary friend that she can""t bear to part with. She used to always wave her little hands at something neither of us could see or hear. When she grew older, she filled her room with drawings and paintings of a man with black eyes. At first, we thought she""d overheard someone talking about the Outsider and decided he""d make a good playmate for her little games. There aren""t many children around this area for her to play with, after all. But the way she speaks...it""s beginning to sound too much like she has an acquaintance with the real thing. If so, the Overseers will have her one way or the other. I""d prefer that she was on the right side of the mask. Ana closed the journal. I can""t read anymore... ""Why didn""t you tell me?"" she demanded, but only the wind answered. Frustrated, she shoved the metal box and its contents into her traveling bag. So either you can""t tell me or you just won""t... She looked at the empty shrine when she returned back downstairs. There was still no sign of The Outsider. Am I boring you? Is that it? Or are you trying to get me to go somewhere else now? She left the house. Though she""d been feeling very sick earlier from the smell, she had gradually gotten hungry without noticing. Now her stomach wouldn""t shut up. She felt weak and thirsty as well. I have to find food and water and a place to stay that isn""t crawling with rats, she thought miserably, I won""t have time to think about all this if I""m dead. A gurgling moan followed by a shuffle jerked her out of her lamentations.",870118
386,"""GET HIM!"" Everyone came in with weapons to hunt Lars down and kill him thinking that this is a lesson to be taught and just then, everyone ganged up on him and attacked him, head-on. Lars got punched in the face and someone whacked him in the face with a sledgehammer, causing him to fall down to the ground, his face badly bloody and bruised. Lars spat out blood and he tries desperately to get help by texting his friends on his Who-phone for help, but before he could send the message, Jesse quickly ran to him at knifepoint and grabs him by the arm and puts the knife on Lars"" throat. He was immediately scared and fearful of his life and Jesse said, ""You mexicans are all the same. I bet you""re gonna murder any one of us the same way one murdered my my dad""s best friend when he took a vacation there!"" Lars struggled to get free and he asked, ""Why would you think my family would do something like that to you?"" ""I swore one day that any Mexican that stepped foot in our school will feel the same way I felt! My dad hated the Mexicans for that and I""m doing the honor for my father!"" Jesse screamed. ""Just because someone did something bad to your padre doesn""t mean we""re gonna do that too! You got us all wrong. We mexicans are good people!"" Lars shouted. ""Shut up! I knew you would be a threat to our reputation and I will personally end this right now!"" Just as Jesse was gonna slit his throat, someone out of the blue gave him a head-butt, causing him to let go of Lars and when Lars looked up, he saw Marcus standing there and he asked, ""You all right, Lars?"" ""Si."" he quickly responded. Jesse got up and he saw Marcus standing there and he was about to beat the crap out of him and he said, ""Why the hell would you defend this poser?"" ""He""s not the poser! You are!"" Marcus spat out. Just then, the others came to abruptly stop the discrimination war, but the others simply refuse to back down and as they came around with guns, knives and various weapons to use at Lars. Jojo was having none of it and he said, ""Why are you all so damn afraid of Mexicans? You""d gave to go this much further to kill Lars? What did he ever do to you anyway?"" ""He""ll become more popular than us! And if someone steps in to threaten our status, we bring them down...no matter what it takes."" One popular who responded. ""Does it really matter what they look like or who they are?"" asked Diego. ""Yes! In this school, if you wanna be popular...you have to ditch the life you""re in. Otherwise, we will shun you on purpose!"" another jock added. Brent was definitely fed up with all of this and started shouting at everyone in angry Spanish and maybe include a little bit of expletives in there as well and Lars completely agreed with anything he said and Jesse said, ""Shut up! Brent...you""ve signed your death certificate!"" Jesse was about to pull the trigger and aim at Lars, but surprisingly...Brent pushed him out of the way and he got shot in the arm, taking a bullet for him. Brent then fell down to the ground and Diego quickly ran over to his side and said, ""Brent! Brent, wake up, man!""",1276465
3828,"""Van..."" Raven spoke softly as both were being drawn to each other by something unknown. ""Raven...I..."" Van spoke back, his hard on was visibly showing in the thin material of his towel. Not that he""d mind anyway. Each looked in to the other for a while... And Van closed the distance for both of them... He softly took Raven to his mouth, and Raven offered no resistance. Van grinded his body against Raven""s, which the other totally complied with. He was all his... ""Rrrrnggrhhh?"" And Zeke hit the sanity bell hard enough for both of them to hear. Each was blushing hard and well aware of what they had just professed to each other.

""I shouldn""t feel attached too much, he is my ene...""Van thought. Enemy? Why do I keep forgetting that he isn""t Raven? Well, he is Raven but, not in a sense that... Damn feelings I got... As Van looked back to the other boy, Raven was already running towards the door and out to the corridors. Poor guy, he""s just as confused as me... Van decided to give Raven a break. After all, he was the only one he was able to spend his whole day with. It""d be best if he go socialize with the others. Tying his hair back with a band, he decided to wear cargo pants and a sleeveless jacket for comfort. It has been awhile since he wore something that didn""t require prescriptions from a superior. An idea came to him, as he spied on an extra elastic band from his drawer... Raven decided to walk up the flight of stairs to the rooftop. While walking, he met a girl named Fiona who was being courted by a guy named Thomas. The guy named Irvine on the meantime, was just leaning against the wall. Spying on me, perhaps? Why the heck would he do that?",583064
3667,"If he gives her the money she says she is going to donate it to charity."" Roman was glaring at her as their lawyer""s bickered back and forth. They didn""t say a word, her gaze unwavering and strict. She was back to being that less confident shy girl that she was before. It was rather odd for a divorce to be about giving more than taking, half the things the lawyers were arguing about were mostly issues on who would accept what and why not. Lina looked down at her lap and fiddled with her thumbs. ""What about the condo he is giving her?"" Her eyes perked up and her eyes shot over to meet his lawyer""s. Her lawyer was about to say something, after all they had discussed that whatever he offered her, she would not accept. But this was different. ""Condo?"" ""Yes. His condo in California. He wants to give it to you."" She looked back down at her lap, unsure of whether or not she was doing the right thing. Then she glanced up to meet Roman""s eyes, he pulled a cigar from a box on his desk and put it between his teeth. Not once breaking her gaze. ""No, I can""t accept that."" ""Why not?!"" Roman spat, growing impatient with the fact that she wanted nothing from him. She asked nothing of him anymore. She didn""t say anything back and instead looked down at the back of her fingers. The one with the ring was still there, she wouldn""t dare take it off earlier. She gradually slid it off her finger, Roman sat up and reached across the desk to place his hand on her shaking ones. To prevent her from taking it off. ""Don""t."" He warned past the cigar hanging from his mouth. ""That you will keep."" It was an order and she slid the ring back on her finger and nodded. She would let him have that much, it would make him crazy knowing that she didn""t have something to remind her of him. She noticed that he hadn""t taken his ring off either, he probably would never take it and for some reason that warmed her heart. He pulled his hand away and dropped back down into his seat. ""Um... Lina wants to offer you something as well. It is small, but I suppose it is substantial."" The lawyer lifted up his suitcase and opened it, pulling out an orange envelope and placing it on Roman""s desk. Roman shoved his cigar into its tray, it was hardly half way finished. He picked up the envelope and ripped through it impatiently. When he saw the image of a tiny fetus inside, he nearly broke down, the first time he would have in his entire life. ""It was a boy. You told me you didn""t want to know until it was born."" His eyes went back up to hers and he took a deep breath. She was smiling slightly, but tears were on their way and she was forcing them back. ""Why are we doing this? If you want me to treat you right, I can do that."" Her smile disappeared and she shook her head. ""You say that every time."" Roman kept his lips shut after that. ""Can we continue?"" She said to her lawyer and he did. When it seemed like everything was finished, they were to sign something of their approval. Roman mindlessly scribbled a line and pushed the document away.",6234395
1672,"Instead, he turned suddenly, pushing Satine behind him, so her back pressed against the wall that surrounded the town. He stood between her and the ever-growing throng people that surrounded them. Now would be a good time to have a lightsaber, he thought wryly. Although for the most part, the townspeople appeared to be nothing more than simple villagers, he had learned long ago that you could never count out a Mandalorian regardless of their station. Almost all had been trained in combat since birth, meaning a farmer could be just as deadly as an assassin or bounty hunter, and more than a match for an unarmed jedi padawan and a pacifist duchess. The crowd was pressing in on them, led by the man who had first recognized Satine. ""We live in hell, mhi cuye o""r dar""yaim, while this hut""uunla Duchess, this dar""manda, runs away and conspires with the Jetiise!"" ""Stay back,"" Obi-Wan warned. The crowd didn""t listen, just pressed forward. He took a step backwards. ""I say we give her over to the bounty hunters-split the reward,"" the second man added. ""Gra""tua par Mandalore!"" Soon the cry carried through the crowd. ""Gra""tua par Mandalore! Gra""tua par Mandalore!"" ""I""m guessing they""re not surrendering,"" Obi-Wan whispered drily to Satine, taking another step back, so he was practically on top of her. With no more room for him to retreat, the crowd finally halted. They were completely surrounded-if he reached out a hand, he could practically brush the chest of the leader. Satine didn""t respond; she was too busy staring into the mob. Obi-Wan followed her gaze, and saw that the old woman from the booth had joined the crowd. Though he wasn""t exactly surprised, he could practically feel the sadness and weariness rolling off the Duchess. ""Don""t come any closer,"" Obi-Wan said, addressing the man in front in particular. ""I don""t want to hurt you."" The man laughed derisively. ""Arrogant little Jetii."" He took a step forward, so he and Obi-Wan were mere inches apart. ""I will crush you."" The man raised his fists and Obi-Wan raised his own hands, ready to force-push him back. ""STOP!"" Ridiculously, Satine""s cry was so unexpected it actually worked-both Obi-Wan and the man turned to her in surprise. Before he was completely cognizant of what was happening, she had slipped under Obi-Wan""s raised arms and pushed him back, so he was pressed against the wall and she stood unprotected before the mob of angry Mandalorians. His shock was matched by the man he had been about to fight, who, somewhat ironically, looked unsure of how to proceed, now that the exact thing he wanted was standing before him. The Duchess however exhibited none of his hesitation. Looking to the crowd, she calmly removed her hood. ""I am Satine Kryze of Clan Kryze, Duchess of Mandalore."" She paused a moment before continuing. ""I beg you to let us go without violence."" ""What are you doing?"" Obi-Wan whispered fiercely, trying to maneuver around her. She pushed him back with surprising force. ""Let me handle this, Obi,"" she whispered back. ""Not all of us have forgotten our heritage.""",2943978
3139,"Razor dodged the lashes and jumped high. With the sun at his back he used Solar Beam and blasted her full on. Ivy briefly lost conscious and fell to her knees. Then, with rigid determination, she attacked again with Razor Leaf. Razor dodged and just as he was about to counter it, he paused and glared into the trees. ""This is a private battle,"" he snapped. Some brief rustling later and Whip leaped out of the trees. ""Sorry, didn""t know I needed a ticket to watch you cream a pre-evolutionary girl."" Ivy cut him a glare. ""You heard him, moss-for-brains: beat it!"" ""Why should I?"" Whip demanded. ""I""m just as much Pokémon as you!"" ""Leave, or would you rather battle someone""s who""s gone up against the Battle Frontier and the Ever Grande Conference?"" Razor repeated, amber eyes unwavering. Ivy felt respect bloom from her every molecule for the hardened fighter. She also had more respect for Ash too. To have raised an awesome Grass-type... Whip visibly stiffened. Then, he lashed out. ""Then why aren""t you fighting her full-power? You could have creamed her in seconds."" Ivy tensed and then her anger let loose. She lashed out with Vine Whip, slapping Whip several times before exhaustion got the best of her. ""You pompous, lily-livered, moss-for-brains, low to the ground Magicarp! I""m steamed now!"" Whip picked himself up, rubbing his cheeks. ""You wanna go small fry?"" Ivy glared at him, her cool composure lost to the winds of Ho-Oh. ""It""s on, stinkweed-breath!"" Just as they were about to collide, Razor stepped in. ""Enough! Charger-"" (Ash""s Bulbasaur) ""may not be here to play peacemaker, but I sure and Suicune am not going to watch you two seedlings go at it like a couple of Snubulls!"" Whip relaxed then smirked. ""Fine... Next time our trainers"" battle; I hope we get paired up, cupcake. Because I""ll cream your clock and make you admit who""s better."" Razor made his way to the lone tree near Oak""s lab. There, he found Ivy, who was still sulking about what had happened two hours ago. ""Found you,"" he said by way of greeting. Ivy jolted slightly then shot him a glare. ""I see... Bye."" She turned back to watch the sky. Razor sat down on the branch next to her. ""So... you like this Whip-guy?"" Ivy colored, the pale green-cream of her cheeks hued pink. ""N-no- I-"" He shook his head. ""I can tell. It hurts when the person you love won""t acknowledge your power, doesn""t it?"" He knew the feeling. His own brief romance had taught him a lot, even if all he gained from it was the heartbreak that he wasn""t as handsome as a Tropius. He winced as he remembered the beauty that had rejected him like May""s Purple Surprise. ""Don""t tell anyone about this!"" Ivy demanded. ""I don""t want anyone to know."" Razor sat back a little and looked up at the clouds. ""So... Is this why you want to get stronger-to prove to Whip you""re just as great as him?"" Ivy numbly nodded. ""My older brother, Pine-he was a great Snivy! It only took him a few days to evolve into a Serperior. And Whip""s already a Servine. I just feel... I feel like I have to be stronger.",3439302

839,"It took longer than usual because of his emotional state, but just when he""d almost reached that point of zen, an unwelcome thought burst into his head. What if the Sword chose wrong? But instead of coming back to the real world, Lion-O found himself being thrown elsewhere. Or more accurately, it felt as though he""d made the connection with the Sword of Omens, and it was pulling him into itself. When Lion-O opened his eyes, he found himself in a place much like what the realm of Thundera once was. Though it was a little off, as there was a tension in the air, as if a threat was coming. It was the first time the Sword had ever done something like this, transported him to another time and place. It reminded Lion-O of his time in the Book of Omens. ""Are you really so surprised? We share similar names, should we not share other traits as well?"" Lion-O was stunned by the appearance of a companion. It was a silver, female ThunderCat. Long and lean, she had the sharpest teeth and claws he""d ever seen. ""Who are you?"" The other cat smiled, ""Do you really not know? I""m hurt, Lion-O. After all, I am a part of you."" Lion-O felt as though he""d stumbled into a dream. ""You""re the Sword of Omens."" The stunning cat smiled even wider, ""And the others doubt your intelligence."" ""Why are you like that?"" He motioned to her (its?) stunning figure. ""Oh, I can take any form I wish in here."" She deliberately posed in a manner that made her even more striking. ""It seemed the best way to get your attention, to be an attractive female."" Her red eyes glittered, ""A lesson Cheetara seems to know well."" Lion-O blushed and the Sword of Omens laughed. She threw an arm around his shoulders to comfort him, ""Don""t be embarrassed, child. I""ve seen much in my many years. Now come, think of me as your guide here."" Lion-O followed, but asked, ""Where are we?"" ""A plane of existence, much like the ones you""ve visited before, only this one is mine, so only the bearer of the Sword, or me, can enter here. By the way, only you can hear and see me though everyone else here sees you as the Lion-O of this realm."" Lion-O looked down, and saw that we was garbed in his old royal attire though he appeared he was also far more grown. He also noticed they were headed to the palace. ""Okay then. But why are we here?"" His guide smirked, as though she had a secret, ""To reassure you that I never choose wrong."" Lion-O was confused, and growing tired of his guide""s riddling answers. He was secretly glad his sword couldn""t talk under normal circumstances or else he""d probably have constant headaches. ""What does that mean?"" Now that they were in the palace, his guide stopped walking. She looked over her shoulder to answer him, rather than turning fully, ""In this plane of existence, Tygra was chosen as king and it""s been two years since the war against Mumm-Ra began. Though few died in the first attack, unlike in your world. So he has an army to fight with."" Lion-O""s ears flattened. So he was a complete failure here and in his own world?",1497577
596,"Van is somewhere around here, in this vicinity."" Thomas eyed the surrounding terrain. His eye caught a glance of movement in the corner. ""We better leave, now."" Raven watched them carefully; as he made a last minute attempt in spying that the trio had left the area. Although it would have been easier if he just took them down personally, Raven was worried Van might be a bit harsher than him. After all, he clearly remembers them when he had his amnesia. And they seemed nice enough... ""For homosexual werewolves that is...""Raven mused as he looked back at Van, who was hugging his knees, his eyes carefully observing the boulder by the corner. Raven sat close by Van, his hood still covering his face. He was tired all morning, and never expected that they would show up. He had many plans for Van and him this day. Maybe shopping for new clothes (peh, they needed new disguises, didn""t they? ), go sightseeing in town (Hiltz and Ryss appearance started to bored him, and I guess he assumed Van felt the same) and by night, see the stars across the night sky, while lying on the cornfield across town. It was his favorite sanctuary after all... ""Well, well, well. If it isn""t Mr. I-own-this-cute-and-handsome-guy..."" Raven looked back to who it was. It was the rogue pilot (who sported the same hairdo as Raven""s) they met at the inn. Apparently, she brought her sisters along (who also sported the same hairdo, although one was yellow and the other was neon green). ""I never forgot you. Now, you""ll pay for insulting me!"" Pink hair snapped. ""When you insult one..."" Yellow hair continued. ""...You insult us!!!"" Green hair finished. And with a weird, and strangely funny, group pose, the trio shouted. ""The Black Crow Gang!!!"" Raven sweatdropped under his hood, as Van just stared at them like some malignant cancer. ""Amateurs..."" Raven finally spoke. ""Grrr, how dare you taint our ears with your childish rebellion and insolence!"" Pink hair grew a vein on her knuckles. ""Let""s teach him about manners, sisters!"" Pink hair commanded, as the three women brandished leather whips that were earlier strapped on their hips. The women were particularly dangerous-looking already. And it seemed that Raven and Van are gonna experience a whole world of pain... ‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡ Yeah!!! I finally got my first review!!! (starts to flood tears) Raven: What happened B? I got my review Raven! My first review! Raven: Good for you...(looks back at the sleeping Van) Oh...right. Sorry, Raven... Raven: It""s ok, just go on with your work. I""ll mind Van for a little while. Raven""s having one of those mood swings, I guess. I really sympathize with him, it""s been a day already and Van is still sleeping. But... ...My first glorious review!!! Ne, chocolate-kun! Thank you very much!!! Domo arigato gozaimasu! Thanks for the whole 4 reviews!!! It""s nice to receive a review; it makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside.

2541,"WE KNOW WHAT YOU DID TO THOSE INNOCENT PEOPLE...TURN THEM BACK!"" Eddy then says ""No way! they deserved it, and besides I made enough money to buy the whole Candy store! I got jawbreakers for all of you!"" Double D and Eddy then get their jawbreakers but as Eddy is about to put it in his mouth it turned into gold, it shocked him so much he took Ed""s jawbreaker and it turned into gold, Eddy was so shocked and Double D then says ""You didn""t read the story huh?

Eddy interrupts him by saying ""So it was a minor setback...at least I""m rich! and if I""m rich then... NAZZ CAN BE MY GIRLFRIEND!"" Unfortunately, Nazz was in the next block and Eddy rushes up to her and Nazz says ""Hi Eddy, what""s up? normally you would be nervous around me, what""s the occasion?"" Eddy then says ""I""m now rich and Kevin kept compensating that he has a little dork, so you can be my girlfriend now!"" Nazz gets shocked by this and she says ""Umm... Eddy I dunno an...""

Not only I can""t eat, drink, and slurp jawbreakers, but I can""t even date or kiss a girl...WHAT HAVE I DONE!!!!"" Before Double D and Ed can say anything, a crimson mist appears and he hears a voice that says ""Wanna know what you did... YOU WENT OVER $666 MILLION DOLLARS...NOW THE DEAL IS COMPLETE...YOU""RE MINE!"" A dark vortex opens up and Eddy is about to be sucked into it and he""s holding on to a street lamp, Double D goes up to the Demon and says ""Ok you Alfred E. Khan look-a-like, what is the meaning of this and what are you going to do with the people Eddy turned into golden statues?"" The Demon then says ""Look at this contract he signed...WRITTEN IN BLOOD!...oh and I will own the souls of the Kankers, Sarah, Nazz, and that plank of wood just for kicks just for being victims of my dark magic but I mostly want the soul of that greedy son-of-a-gun! his soul has ""greed"" written all over it!""

The trial will begin(To Eddy) As for you meat...YOU WILL SPEND A DAY IN HFIL!!! THE HOME FOR INFINATE LOSERS!"" Eddy then says ""OH NO! NOT THERE! ANYTHING BUT...Isn""t it supposed to be Hel...""

1071,"Ahhhh. Of course. Jason should""ve picked up on that. After all, he had spent eight months surrounded by a campful of Greek demigods, most of whom were completely fluent in ancient Greek, but his ear just couldn""t pick it up. At first he had tried to learn it, a task that proved impossible. Besides the odd curse word he""d picked up from the Ares cabin, he didn""t understand Greek at all. Leo listened for a few more seconds, but eventually sighed and gave it up. ""I couldn""t get much. They were talking fast and it was hard to understand their accents, but I caught a few words."" ""What were they?"" Jason asked. ""Others, demigods, mountain, angry, bring, Gaia. That was about it."" ""Others and demigods? Maybe they know where everyone is!"" Jason said excitedly. He hadn""t missed the mention of Gaia, but he preferred not to think about it at the moment. Besides, they had bigger problems on their hands anyway. ""Yeah."" Leo looked down. ""Sorry I couldn""t get more. I""ve never been very good at ancient Greek. If only An-"" he caught himself and broke off. Jason simply nodded. ""Yeah. If only."" Suddenly the two monkeys cut off their lengthy conversation and turned toward Jason and Leo. They started speaking in unison. ""You are the sons of Hephaestus and Zeus."" It wasn""t exactly a question. Jason sighed, but fought down the urge to correct them that his father was in fact Jupiter, not Zeus. ""Our mistress wishes to see you."" They were still speaking together in their strange hissing way. ""Yeah well, I think we""ll politely decline!"" Jason shouted. ""Oh but you must! Our mistress will be angry if we don""t bring you to her!"" two identical grins that Jason didn""t much like spread over the faces of the monkeys. ""You see, our mistress holds your friends in her palace. She will be angry if you don""t come."" Jason gritted his teeth and tightened his grip on the gladius, but resisted the urge to attack. ""Fine. Tell us where they are, and we won""t kill you!"" Jason shouted back to them, trying to sound confident. The monkeys let out a long string of hissing, and it took Jason a second to realize they were laughing. Okay, now he was really mad. ""How do we know our friends at all? You could just be lying to us! I doubt you two could have defeated them!"" he said, trying to goad the creatures into betraying the location of the others. ""We are the Cercopes,"" they said, as if this was an explanation. ""They stood no chance against us."" ""Oh really?"" Leo asked, hefting a crowbar he had pulled from his belt. ""Yes. The pretty one tried to charm us with her words, but it didn""t work. We are the masters of speech."" Jason had had enough of this. Raising his sword, he lunged at the closest creature. The creature started hissing again. ""With your sword you""ll no longer fight, for it slinks and slithers and bites!"" Jason felt something change in his hands. When he looked up at his sword, he saw that he was no longer holding the golden blade; now, he was holding the tail of a huge snake. He yelped and dropped it, falling back a few feet. ""Jason! What happened?"" Leo called. ""Are you alright?""",2943978
3023,"Ender watched as the lead teen- a rich punk Homebase identified as Devon Brace- pointed to the brickwall of the group- a tubby little porker named Edwin Phillips. He said something and then took the steps to the building. The rest of guys followed and then Edwin took a menacing stance in front of the door. Ender slipped further back into the shadows before making the four touch dismount to the roof. He found a niche right before the roof and waited. Homebase theorized that their target lived in 23E, and she was rarely wrong with her intel. Sure enough, Brace kicked in the flimsy door of the apartment, startling the hunched figure on the couch. A pale and skinny woman with greasy, dirty hair, the color hidden by the grime, stumbled to her bare feet, eyes wide. ""Where""s our money, Irma?"" sneered Yosif Berken, the crew""s resident mouthpiece. ""Irma"" shook her head. ""Y-you""re said- you said I-I had another w- week. Y-you promised."" She looked accusingly at the teen, but held herself protectively. ""Things change."" Berken leered at her barely clad body. Irma backed away, towards her purse. Ruffling through, she threw a fistful of cash at them. ""H-here! Take it! It""s all I have."" Ender calculated seven hundred creds. Maybe half of Berken""s reported allowance. Chump change to any of the families involved. Ender growled low in his throat. In his ear, Homebase hissed, ""Surveillance only."" Brace""s eyes swept over the money on the floor before him. ""Where""s the rest?"" ""I-I don""t have it..."" Irma mumbled shuffling closer to the window. ""Don""t have it?"" Brace cocked his head to the side. ""Well that""s fine then. Where""s the interest?"" Irma""s bare feet shuffled one over the other. ""I don""t...I- I don""t..."" Brace sighed painstakingly. ""Then I guess Yosif owns you now."" Berken grinned, an eerie grin of a budding sexual predator in the making. Junior stepped forward. ""Dev, come on, the joke""s gone too far."" Brace suddenly rounded on his morally awake peer, clocking him upside the head without a thought. Junior stumbled back into the other three guys. ""Don""t ever call me ""Dev""!"" His eyes had a crazy light in them. Murderous, but also painfully hurt. The other three clamped down on his arms and kept him from further harm to Junior. ""Chill, Brace!"" ""Yeah cool or we all lose out!"" ""Douse it, Devon!"" Berken paid none of them mind, too busy visually stalking his prey. Irma was almost to the nearby door before Berken suddenly lunged and grabbed her arm. She yelped and tried to pull away, her scream drawing the attention of the others. ""Look what tried to get away."" snickered Yosif. ""Please- just lemme go..."" Ender ground his molars, before barking to Homebase, ""Sorry, I""m breaking cover."" ""Ender, no-"" But he was already leaping through the window, showering glass over an unsuspecting Berken. The teen looked up too late, Ender""s size twelve titanium soled boots hitting him square in the chest, rocketing him back and away from the cowering woman. ""Anyone ever teach you boys it""s impolite to touch an unwilling woman?"" Ender growled, glaring at the teens.",3439302
1915,"Blood streamed down to a floor, which was covered with ancient writings. As he moved his hand slowly across the words, they lit up one by one in a bright red. The words soaked up the blood with a grotesque hunger. ""Shit."" This was the worst part of the ritual; having to cut his palm over and over again, for the dark words printed below made cease the bleeding in his hand. The pain stayed, the cut stayed, but the blood would not leak out onto the floor. Wolfram had to bite his lip in pain, the only thing he could do to hold back his calls. This continued though the night until the sun started to rise. Finally, finally the end would come. The ancient words, spoken aloud with his blood sacrifice, filled him with a wild, untapped power that he didn""t hold before. His tired body would revitalize, feeling refreshed like it would after a normal nights rest. This magic, this power made him the one of the most powerful kings in existence; with this, he could truly be called a King. No longer would he be weak and powerless. No longer would he have to be protected, for that time was long over. He only glanced over calmly towards the door as Greta strode in. She had been waiting patiently for him to finish, however long that might have been. That and her recent run in with one of the captains left her with an unsettled feeling she couldn""t describe or shake off. ""Father,"" she spoke. ""How are you today?"" A smile crossed Wolframs lips. ""Greta,"" he reached out, and held her in his arms gently. ""The same as always, Greta. I feel better when you are by my side though."" Letting her go, he flopped down in the chair behind him and Greta scoured the area for both the first aid kit at the tool box. She kneeled down in front of him, already wrapped the bandages around his hand to cover up the wounds. A lesion that only time could heal; for no amount of healing magic could touch it. ""Father, are your legs okay? You have to let me know when you need maintenance but you""re so stubborn sometimes."" Wolfram didn""t"" respond, but she knew from his expression that his legs had been bothering him for some time. Because she was often busy, she didn""t get many chances to just sit and talk with him like this. Without hesitation Greta started tinkering with Wolfram""s bio-mechanical knees and shins. ""Eww... father, that""s gross! The skin clamps for your legs are infected again... really..."" ""They will pay, Greta. They will all pay... for doing this to me. We""ve already gone past the point of redemption. Yuuri would be... so sad now, about us."" Wolfram""s voice was solemn, but they both knew it was the truth. These times reminded Wolfram of his handicap more than ever, leaving the two in silence. This was the price he had paid for destroying the world that Yuuri worked so hard to build. One or two wars, countless fighting and sinning, though all this he had forgotten the exact time the incident happened. Wolfram violently shook off the thoughts and returned his attention back to Greta. Despite all her complaints, Greta couldn""t help but smile.",583994
3605,"With this, he pulled her closer, close enough for the princess to fall on his chest. ""Listen up, princess. We""re both at fault here. Accept that fact and everything""s okay again."" Princess Bubblegum blushed, feeling his hot breath on her face. She was too close, she thought. It was also at this moment that she realized that the young vampire was quite handsome. Marshall Lee stared at her eyes a bit more and found fright on it. He pushed her away hurriedly and turned around to cover the blush on his face. ""Damn it, princess."" He muttered. ""What did I do this time, huh?"" ""Oh, you did nothing at all."" He said, a bit of sarcasm obvious in his voice. ""You did absolutely nothing and made me blush this way. Damn it, blush won""t go away.' Princess Bubblegum smiled a bit when she saw a faint blush on the side of his cheek. ""Okay, Marshall Lee."" She said. ""Marceline, I found nothing on my side. How about you?"" Finn said. ""No luck."" She said. Then, she turned to Jake, the last person to return. ""Nothing, guys."" He said. All three gave each other a glance then nodded. ""To the Southern side we go!"" Jake said, a bit excited. ""RADICAL!"" Finn said as he raised his sword. Marceline sighed, and then smiled. ""Boys."" She mumbled. Aaaaaaand that ends chapter 3. The next chappie might be a little later :) I have a 3-day retreat in my school... and I am busy... so yah. See ya""ll! Sorry for the veeeeeeeery late update guys D: I had this very annoying author""s block plus, I""ve still got three hanging fanfics to continue and people are begging me to update. So if it""s a bit rushed, please forgive me. I did my best. Finn, Jake and Marceline reached the Southern side and they started searching for Princess Bubblegum and Marshall Lee. Finn decided to look inside the rooms, Jake searched in the lobby while Marceline went for the attic. As they agreed on, when no one finds nothing or finds something, they would all come back to their meeting place in the South. Marceline floated up to the attic and pulled out a few cobwebs. She noticed that some boxes were moved, as if someone had just been there. She smirked, and then went inside further. She heard some voices just around the corner and floated slowly to that side of the attic. The Vampire Queen was about to surprise attack whoever voice that was, but stopped herself abruptly upon realizing that it was the two people there were looking for. Marshall Lee""s back was facing Marceline, but she could still see a faint smudge of pink on his ear while Princess Bubblegum""s face is clearly seen from Marceline""s perspective. Much to her surprise, the young princess is smiling oddly. A real, genuine smile was sported on the princess""s gentle face. ""She made Bonnie smile."" She said to herself in disbelief. ""He has skills!"" she floated backwards, wanting to give them both their privacy but she accidentally bumped on one of the boxes behind her that caused a pretty loud noise that startled Princess Bubblegum and Marshall Lee. ""Marceline?"" the princess called out.",2750536
2093,"The whole sky would be full of clouds if it would rain. You""ll see one day, I""m sure."" Akito wondered where the sky began and where it ended. It seemed to have no end at all, nor a beginning. It just keeps going and going and going...forever, it looks like... ""We""re almost there,"" Tohru""s chipper voice interrupted his musings, ""it seems perfect, like you""re the one who was meant to come back here after all this time."" She opened the door and Shigure wheeled him through. At first, it seemed as if the walls were made of vines, but he realized it was just that there were so many of them. Despite the garden""s mostly ruined appearance, it was the most amazing thing he""d ever seen. Tohru, Kyo, and Yuki had cleared most of the beds out and now there were tiny, tiny sprouts poking out of the earth. A few very early spring flowers were already blooming. A few brave butterflies flitted from blossom to blossom. Birds were singing and many of the nests were full of wide-open beaks demanding to be fed. Scrub-brushes were sitting on the edge of a fountain that had formerly been covered with moss. The basin was bone-dry now, but they would eventually get it working if they could figure out how. ""This place is pretty big, too, isn""t it?"" Tohru asked. ""Very,"" Akito answered, ""what""s that over there?"" They all exchanged glances. The swing, the one accused of causing Akito to be born too soon, was swaying gently in the breeze. ""That""s a swing,"" Tohru said, ""it""s a little like you""re chair, but it moves back and forth. Watch."" She sat on the swing and ran back and forth a couple of times to build up some momentum. Then, she let her feet leave the ground and actually swung for a bit. After a moment, she nimbly leapt off. ""You should try it,"" she said. ""I will,"" Akito said, pushing the basket towards Shigure, ""I""ll bet I go even higher than you!"" ""It takes practice,"" Tohru said, ""but I""m sure you will."" He couldn""t get the swing going, so Tohru told him just to keep his feet tucked in. With a little difficulty, she got the swing going, then only had to push at his back. ""Hang on tight, Akito! Don""t fall off!"" she warned. ""I won""t! Faster!"" At first, he thought he was going to throw up as the world jerked first one way, then the other. It was as if his stomach was always hanging in one spot while the rest of his body went the other way. Then, as the nausea passed, he found a wild burst of laughter escaping his throat. It was like... ""Flying,"" he whispered into the breeze, ""I feel like I""m flying..."" It took a long time for him to want off the swing. Once they had him settled in the chair again, they began to show him around. ""Not everything""s bloomed yet,"" Tohru explained, ""but it will soon. There will be roses over there, and daisies here and lilies! And these trees are cherry blossom trees. They""ll be pinker than a baby""s cheeks!"" He watched a monarch butterfly tasting the first few blossoms that had opened. Periodically, birds would fly overhead and he""d watch them to see where they were going. Once he craned his neck so much that he thought it was going to snap.",870118

This is the second chapter of a prequel so This Story takes place days before the day Grim met the Eds...and it explains why Eddy hates demons and making deal with demons. Also this story may be dark but hey, anything to get your attention! I just got a E-mail about the name of the demon, he is nameless but he resembles 4KIDS president Alfred E. Khan, the most evil man in all of anime. So if the demon has a name, the name is ""That jerk who ruined ""One Piece"" and ""Shaman King""!"" ""Due to my strong personal convictions, I wish to stress that this fanfic in no way endorses Satanism."" -Neowinterknight- (yes, this is a parody of the disclaimer from ""Michael Jackson""s Thriller"") I hope no one notices I reused Hell jokes from my past fanfics but I really want Eddy""s hell to be so scary and surreal, it will make ""SUPERJAIL"" look like Kindergarden... ENJOY! Last Time: In the days that took place before the Eds met Grim, Eddy does the unthinkable and he makes a deal with a demon who strangly resembles Alfred E. Khan, chairman of 4KIDS (he""s just plain evil... ok?) so Eddy ends up with the midas touch, a power that turns anything the user touches into gold but Eddy got too much he can handle when his clothes turn to gold, his food, drink, and jawbreakers turn to gold...and kids into gold. He accidentally turned Nazz into gold (except for Sarah, Plank, and the Kankers... they deserved that!) but when Eddy""s run ran out, the demon came back to claim his soul and those he turned into gold. Double D stood up to the demon and arranged a trial that could save Eddy and the others from a face worse than death and break-up. As Double D is studying law while trying to save Eddy and Ed goof off with the golden statues and attempting to make out with the golden Nazz statue while watching ""Creepshow"", Eddy is having a...HFIL of a time! Note that since the demon thinks he""s Alfred E. Khan he even censored the name of his own domain into ""Home For Infinite Losers"". And now We continue the story and see what Eddy""s going through!",910821
3694,"Aurora was out in the gardens when Iracebeth came outside. Though she was angry, it cheered the Red Queen up slightly when she saw how miserable Aurora was. ""I had a lot of faith him, too,"" Iracebeth commented, ""I suppose you know that if I lose my crown that you""ll lose your job."" Aurora nodded. ""You know...my sister wouldn""t recognize you. You""d be practically the only one in my courts that she wouldn""t recognize. You could go and get the Vorpal Sword back from Marmoreal."" Aurora cringed inwardly.

Perhaps we can fix Ilosovic""s little blunder..."" Aurora, as usual, was silent. ""He""s lucky I""m so crazy about him,"" Iracebeth muttered, ""and then come to find out that Um is actually Alice!

If I catch that girl, I""ll chop her head off myself!"" It had started off as a mutter and ended as a roar. Aurora kept a completely straight face and even managed to force a look of concern. ""You know, Aurora, I rather like you! You listen so much better than the others!"" Iracebeth was beginning to feel better. Glad to be of service, Aurora thought dryly. ""Let""s go do another painting! I shall soon have enough to fill the castle!"" Iracebeth announced, not nearly as furious as she had been. Wearily, Aurora rose to follow her. She wondered if Stayne was feeling better yet. It wasn""t until that night that he""d gathered his courage to face her again. Stayne was used to people being angry with him. For some reason, Aurora being furious with him really got under his skin. It was more than the fact that she""d be his future queen (if he was lucky). It was more than the fact that she knew far too much and she could easily sell him out. The fact that he wasn""t dead yet was a testament to her feelings...she at least liked him enough to not want him dead. He finally found her on one of the balconies. She sat there staring off into space. It didn""t escape his notice that she was looking in the direction of Marmoreal. ""Aurora."" It was so hard to say her name in that moment. There was a bit of a sting when she didn""t acknowledge him. He sat down beside her. ""You""re not making this easy, you know,"" he said accusingly. She didn""t look at him. ""Fine...maybe I don""t deserve easy,"" he choked out awkwardly. He took a breath and it all spilled out at once. ""I""m sorry...for everything."" It was vague, but he didn""t feel like announcing every offense out loud. The list was beginning to get very long. A soft, cool breeze blew over both of them and ruffled her curls slightly. He ached to reach out and touch them, but restrained himself. He didn""t want to make it worse.",870118
3356,"Part Five At the Tringams""s place, Ed and Al started unpacking their cases, as well as the clothes Winry had given them, into yet another old parent""s bedroom.

""Don""t worry,"" the lad said, ""Russel and I will be returning to London soon, and then either one of you can take our old room...Miss Noah, though, seems to like the old nursery."" Both Elrics looked up. ""Nursery?"" they asked. Then they peeked into the hall, and saw Russel setting up one of the beds from his and his brother""s room for Noah in a room filled with boxes and such, as well as old toys and a wooden crib pushed into a corner. ""Yes...Though, it was more of a large closet after Mum and Dad passed,"" Fletcher said. Then he stepped back, and asked, ""Al, after church tomorrow, would you like to go fishing with Winry and me?"" ""Um...Oka-"" Al started to say, then Ed interjected, ""After Church? Why not go at sun up when there""s better chances of catching something?"" This, Russel heard, and he looked out to the hallway. ""Everyone in our village goes to Morning Mass,"" the elder Tringam sounded a bit displeased, ""Don""t you and your brother go to church on Sunday?"" Al opened his mouth, but Ed answered, ""We""re scientists. We believe in what we can see. You should understand if you""re studying rocket science."" Russel emerged from the room, leaving the bed half competed, ""My chosen profession has nothing to do with my faith."" ""Faith is well and good,"" Ed said, ""But in my experience, I""ve never seen a single shred of evidence to support what most people believe in."" ""Ed,"" Al said, not wanting them to get into a fight. He and Russel stared each other down, and suddenly the taller man smirked, ""Then let""s make a deal...Call it a scientific experiment."" ""What?"" asked Ed. ""I""ve got five weeks left before Fletch and I have to go back to London. That means, counting tomorrow, we""ll have five Sundays before we go. Come with us to Mass for each of those days, and see if it changes your opinion."" Ed thought it over. Then he held out his hand, ""Alright..."" ""Ed,"" Al said. But he was ignored for the moment as the two men shook on it. When they were done, Russel went back to finish helping Noah with her room. However, Al grabbed Ed""s shoulders, and said, ""Um, Fletcher, can you excuse us?"" then he closed the bedroom door, and said, low, but still spastic, ""What do you think you""re doing!?"" ""Come on,"" Ed said, ""The religions here are no different than the ones we""ve seen. All stories and legends, but no scientific proof."" ""But..."" Al said, ""Why do I feel guilty about this? Shouldn""t we have gone just to be nice? Does it have to be a bet?"" ""It wasn""t a bet,"" Ed assured him. ""Besides, I don""t think it will change anything...I mean, don""t you agree, Al?"" he asked. Al looked down, his expression sheepish, as if he didn""t want to admit something. Ed blinked, then said, ""Al...?"" ""...Its just..."" Al said.",512464
3274,"It was in the cottage they were now beginning to approach that the servant""s old grandmother lived. ""Tell me,"" Zelda asked the girl, ""Why would your grandmother pass the duty of sage to your cousin and not to you? You are just as close in blood."" ""Yes,"" the girl said, ""But I cannot play the fiddle."" ""What does that matter?"" ""Wind Temple sages must be able to play the fiddle to the brothers Zephos and Cyclonus,"" the girl explained. ""I cannot play any instrument. So I was sent to serve in the castle, and my cousin, Fado, apprenticed to our grandmother. Now he serves as sage."" They dismounted from their horses, and the girl knocked on the wooden door. On the door was painted what resembled a green fiddle. ""Grandmother?"" the girl called, ""It""s me, Valla."" They heard small and slow footsteps come from inside, and the door creaked open, revealing a tiny old woman in green. ""Oh my,"" the old woman said, seeing Zelda behind her and also seeing the royal herald on Zeda""s dress, ""Forgive me, Lady, I did not know you would be coming."" ""Forgive this intrusion,"" Zelda said, stepping inside, ""But I have need of your skills."" The old woman ushered her granddaughter in after the impatient princess, and sat down. Zelda then proceeded to tell the old Kokiri about her dream, not a detail was left out. When Zelda finished, the retired sage scratched her chin, then got off her low stool and hobbled off, ""My my, this is puzzling. I must consult Nayaru herself! And you as well, my dear,"" the woman said. ""Follow me, I have just the things,"" Zeld got up and followed the woman to a back room, and as the withered old hand lit a candle, Zelda""s eyes beheld a round table, and in the center a bowl. All around them were flasks and bottles of herbs and seeds and Chu Chu jelly. ""Now, m""lady, sit here,"" the woman said, ""And after I mix a few things, we will speak to the goddess."" ""Thank you, but,"" Zelda replied, ""I thought you served the Wind god brothers."" ""Child,"" the woman said, ""If you will recall, Nayaru made both the waters and the skies. The Wind gods serve her. Therefore I served her, and still do in this old age."" The old woman brought down many herb bags and bottles, poured them into a bowl, then ground them up and put the mush in a bottle of green liquid. ""This is Magic Potion; boosts magic power in whoever drinks it. These herbs will open our minds and hearts to Nayaru""s will and her guidance."" the woman set a cup of the mix in front of Zelda, and said, ""Drink, m""lady. It may not taste good, but it""s still quite healthy."" Zelda warily picked up the cup, held her nose, and downed the concoction. The former sage sat in the chair across from the princess, slowly drank her mix, and then took Zelda""s hand. ""Now we must concentrate,"" the woman said. ""And pray..."" both closed their eyes, and the old woman began mumbling a rhythmic chant. Zelda felt her body growing lighter and lighter, and then she heard the old crone speak, ""Oh great Nayaru, creator of water and air, wisest of all gods! Hear us, Oh Nayaru."" then she whispered, ""Open your eyes, m""lady.""",512464
1501,"He was smart enough to know that in all likelihood it would have no effect on his circumstances aside from leaving him with a sore hand and a scratchy throat, but he had been pissed off. Finally, he had sunk to the floor, head in his hands and dangerously close to tears. Ed hated feeling weak, but as he leaned against the cold wall of the detention center, he couldn""t help it. Life was just so goddamn unfair. Everything that had happened in the past few days, the arrest, his mom-but no, he couldn""t start thinking about that. If he did, Ed wasn""t sure he""d be able to stop. With this in mind, Ed had wiped his cheeks furiously and had taken a few calming breaths. Since then, he""d settled into the stiff mattress of the top bunk and begun counting the small dots on the ceiling tiles, anything to keep his mind busy and off certain thoughts. When that means of distraction was exhausted he""d begun listing the elements of the periodic table in his head. Once he""d finished that he went back through and tried to remember the atomic weight of each element. He was trying to recall whether the weight of Uranium was 238.029 or 237.048 when his thoughts were interrupted by the metal squeaking of the door swinging open. Ed turned his head and watched as someone dressed in the same ill-fitting uniform he was in hopped nimbly from behind the heavy door and entered the room. The boy seemed to be about Ed""s age (albeit a number of inches taller, much to Ed""s chagrin) and was clearly of East Asian descent with a long angular face and lengthy black hair pulled into a low ponytail at the base of his neck. He was smiling, a wide expression that encompassed his entire face. He lifted a hand towards Ed as the door swung shut behind him. ""Hello,"" he said, voice light and calm. ""I""m Ling Yao."" Ed sighed and swung his legs over the side of the bed so he was sitting up, facing the intruder. The boy-Ling-looked at Ed contemplatively, arms crossed casually across his chest as he leaned against the wall adjacent to the door. Once it was clear that Ed had no intention of responding, his eyebrows descended into a more cunning visage. ""And you""re Edward Elric,"" he said, voice taking on a serious lilt. Ed""s forehead furrowed. ""How do you know my name?"" he asked suspiciously. ""I""m your roommate,"" Ling said, shrugging his shoulders. He raised an eyebrow at Ed""s continued silence. ""Surely you didn""t think you got both beds to yourself, did you?"" Still Ed said nothing, simply continued to glare at the strange boy. Although this was his first time at a juvenile detention center, he understood the system well enough to know that it was unlikely that the administration had informed Ling of his name or anything else for that matter. Ling seemed to implicitly understand the other boy""s suspicions and he smiled once more. ""You""re quite the celebrity. Front page of the Times this morning."" Well, I guess Mustang got his article, Ed thought to himself. ""I wasn""t aware the Times had such avid readers in the juvenile correctional system,"" he said. Ling laughed.",2943978
2465,"""Especially when the man is used to wooing."" It was such an archaic word that she couldn""t help but smile at his unknowing charm. He""s rapidly becoming her closest acquaintance in the town, with the notable exception of Mary Margaret. ""Most men I know aren""t interested in romance,"" she says. She""s slept with a number of guys since Henry""s father, but they had all been casual flings. She likes sex, but prefers to avoid the entanglements that a full-fledged relationship might lead to. Nowadays, there is no point in pretending that sex and relationships aren""t two entirely separate things. She""s good at one and crashes and burns at the second. ""Maybe you don""t know the right men,"" he says. ""I understand your former profession might not have... exposed you to positive aspects of society."" She snorts. ""To put it mildly."" He glances down at his hands, then looks into her eyes. ""Forgive me if I can""t divorce myself from my profession,"" he says, ""but have you ever thought you don""t give people enough credit?"" ""No,"" she says bluntly. ""I""ve seen how wicked people can be to each other."" ""They can also be kind,"" Archie replies, his eternal optimism that he can fix things shining through. ""We all have the option to do right."" ""Maybe,"" she replies. ""But my experience is nine times out of ten, someone is going to screw you over if they can."" He winces, and she""s immediately guilty for bringing up a sensitive topic. She knows he might have originally been in Regina""s pocket, but she respects the way he found the courage to stand up for Henry. ""You""re the tenth time,"" she tells him, reaching out and squeezing his hand. ""I know you want what""s best for Henry."" ""I do,"" he tells her. He doesn""t make any kind of suggestion that she is what is best for Henry, and she reminds herself not to be disappointed. Emma Swan hates that she""s becoming yet another statistic for unwed teenage mothers in foster care. She""s eighteen and scared, even though she won""t admit it aloud. Emma believed she was in love, and that her boyfriend was going to be the one she spent the rest of her life with. He was handsome and kind, and when he kissed her, she forgot her own name. All she cared about was the tension in her body, and the way she wanted to melt into him and never let go. He was hers, and she was his and they were going to make their own happiness together. They weren""t perfect, but she thought they had a chance because they loved each other and wanted to make it work. Emma knew all about safe sex thanks to the annual ""chats"" that her school mandated she went through as part of her phys ed classes. But his hands were on her breasts, and there was no way she wanted to slow him down to check to see if he had condoms, because he might have stopped. They had sex, and in the aftermath she decided that for the first time in her life, she was genuinely happy. She didn""t want a storybook romance. She wanted a romance which was all hers. Instead, she gets neither when she finds out the creep is married and she is pregnant.",1112924
184,"Its mighty branches supported the beautiful flowers. ""It is so nice, isn""t it?"" Hotohori walked beside Chidori. She blushed. ""It is,"" Chidori continued to stare at the tree, once in a while, stealing a glance at Hotohori. ""Chidori! Hotohori! Lunch is ready!"" Miaka called even they were only a few meters apart. ""We are only here, no need to shout,"" Hotohori said as he sat down opposite Nuriko. ""Because, it looks like you two are wandering somewhere..."" Miaka whispered to Chidori. Chidori blushed. ""It""s not that..."" Chidori said while Miaka just giggled. She sat down beside Nuriko, opposite Miaka and Tamahome. When everyone was settled, they started to eat. ""Itadakimasu!"" Numerous voices echoed through the air as they chat among each other. Chidori listened as Mitsukake lectured Tamahome on herbal medicines. Chiriko was having an argument with Chichiri on who will win the Soccer match that will be televised later in the evening. ""I think Hotohori likes you,"" Chidori was surprised to hear Nuriko""s voice. She turned to her. ""Of course not!"" Chidori defended, blushing in the same time. ""Aw come on! He""s looking at you...intently,"" Nuriko continued to tease Chidori. Nuriko was right. Out of the corner of Chidori""s eye, she saw that Hotohori was indeed looking at her. Her heart started to beat fast. ""You do make a cute couple..."" Nuriko said thoughtfully. ""Of course not!"" Chidori defended herself again. ""Really???"" ""Um..well...he""s good-looking, cute, kind and has that nice smile on his face...BUT were only friends!"" Chidori twirled her chopsticks. ""Aw! Say that again...after you are married,"" Nuriko giggled as she watched Chidori blush even more. ""We""re just friends!!!"" Everyone became silent as Chidori shouted, ""Ah...it""s nothing!!! hahaha!"" she covered Nuriko""s mouth when the latter attempted to say something. They continued what they were doing as Chidori sighed. She looked around and noticed something. ""Where is Tasuki?"" she asked the still laughing Nuriko. ""Not here. He is so stubborn, you know!"" Nuriko answered after regaining her composure. ""Because of me..."" Chidori whispered. ""AHHHHH!!!"" Suddenly, a figure fell down from the tree and landed flat on the ground. ""Omigosh! Is he still alive?! Help!! Call someone! Police! Doctor! Nurse! Any one!!"" Miaka panicked because the figure landed beside her. ""Tasuki? Are you alright?"" Tamahome approached the figure. ""Tasuki?"" the others also approached him. ""Ouch!"" Tasuki stirred and tried to get up but failed. ""We need to bring you to the hospital. I""ll call the ambulance,"" Mitsukake ran to the nearest phone booth. ""You have a wound!"" Chidori noticed a small cut in his arm. ""That""s nothing,"" Tasuki said as he snatched his arm from Chidori. ""Don""t be so stubborn!"" Chidori shouted. Tasuki just stared at her. She got her handkerchief and wrapped it in his wound. ""Tha...thank you..."" Chidori smiled as she heard Tasuki whisper those words. ""You broke about 3 bones in your ribs..."" Mitsukake concluded. He just finished calling, ""The ambulance will be here in a short while."" ----------------------- ""Yuuhi!",560480
3650,"Joe shook his head at his friend""s antics. ""Whoa- whoa- augh!"" Charles fell to the ground attempting to put on his shorts. ""Smooth,"" Joe grinned. ""Shut up."" Charles heaved himself up. ""You guys? Is this the way to the lockers?"" Martin called. Eyes still closed, his hands still outstretched, he was wandering into the showers. ""Yeah, yeah, buddy. Just keep going straight,"" Cary snickered back. ""I hope we""re not playing dodgeball again,"" Joe said as he pulled on a gray shirt, wincing a bit at the memory. ""Nah, we""re not, they only make us play that once a week,"" Cary informed him, jumping in the air to pull his shorts on. Joe gaped at Cary. ""How do you know?"" ""Have you ever read the school rulebook?"" ""No, why would I?"" ""So if you ever get in trouble you can defend yourself with pure, solid fact,"" Cary explained matter-of-factly. ""Ah..."" ""I... hate... gym..."" Charles puffed ten minutes later as he jogged along the track. Today""s assignment: run three laps around the track (which was equivalent to a mile) in under fifteen minutes. Go over the set time limit, and the day""s work would result in an F. Unfortunately, Joe and Charles were horrendously unfit. Martin was even worse- he lagged about three yards away from them. ""Tell me... about it..."" Joe agreed, his body drenched in sweat. ""God, how does Cary do it?"" Cary finished his laps in six minutes and twenty-seven seconds. Small and wiry, he was the ideal runner- and often got practice from running from police when a firework landed on their car. ""Maybe... he""s on steroids..."" ""Yeah, probably..."" ""Hey, you guys!"" Alice said brightly, jogging past them. Her blonde hair was tied in a sloppy ponytail, but flyaways flew in the breeze nonetheless. She swiveled around and started running backwards to face them. ""Still on your second?"" ""Shut up,"" Joe grumbled. ""Friggin"" Cary is on his seventh, I think."" ""Wow,"" Alice said, impressed. ""I""m only my fourth."" ""How long has it been?"" Charles asked her. ""Er-"" she consulted her watch- ""ten minutes, seventeen seconds."" ""Shit! We""ve only got five minutes to get our third lap! Run, run!"" Charles yelped, sprinting ahead. Joe""s legs felt like lead. ""Charles, if we ever get an A, we""ll be dead!"" he shouted after him. ""No, I""ll be dead when my mom kills me for failing gym!"" Charles called. ""Alright, see ya in the morgue!"" Joe replied. """"Kay!"" Charles yelled back, flashing a thumbs-up sign. He disappeared amidst the other suffering, running kids. ""So, Joe,"" Alice said. ""So, Alice."" ""I think Cary""s officially been bitten by the lovebug."" Joe stopped in his tracks. ""With who?"" ""Elle,"" Alice said promptly. ""That girl in his math class?"" ""Yup."" When Joe had finally processed this information, he finally burst, ""What makes you think that?"" ""Look."" She pointed somewhere across the track. Squinting in the bright sunlight, he could just make out Cary walking with Elle, laughing with her. Light finally dawned on Joe. ""No wonder he wanted to finish his laps so early."" Cary looked particularly happy about something as they changed back into their clothes after class.",2855986
2008,"""Um, I mean... Dylan told me about you"" Brenda eyes lowered and she plastered a half-smile on her face trying to hold back some more tears. ""Well let me take your bags Bren"" Dylan went to pick up Brenda""s bag but was stopped by Gina. ""Oh no, let me Dylan. Why don""t you two get reacquainted"" Gina took the bags and walked off leaving Dylan and Brenda in silence. ""Well make yourself at home, I""ll be right back"" Dylan smiled at Brenda nervously and walked into the back room where Gina was putting Brenda""s bags away. ""What is going on in that little mind of yours? Huh Gina?"" Gina turned around and gave Dylan an innocent smile and continued to fidget with the suitcases. ""Well she is certainly beautiful isn""t she Dylan?"" ""Yes she is"" ""God even her bags are pretty, you must of really loved her"" Dylan was losing his patience. ""Gina! God damn it! What the hell are you trying to pull? I""m not stupid. I know you""re conniving and hurt and jealous. And I know that you must be really pissed at me and wanting some vengeance and there""s Brenda for easy picking so you think what the hell kill two birds with one stone. Am I right?"" ""I have no idea what you""re talking about Dylan, I like her. She seems sweet and kind and I just want to know her better"" ""Yea sure and I am The King of Fricken Egypt! I don""t know what you""re planning in that little conniving brain of yours but just stop it right here and right now, because if you hurt Brenda in any way at all I will make you wish that you never came to Beverly Hills"" Gina smiled once more and left the room while Dylan finished putting Brenda""s bags away. ""Well Brenda it was great meeting you but I have to go. First day of work, I hope to see you again"" With that Gina walked out the door, Brenda watched her leave and continued to watch the TV show. Dylan peeked his head out and sneaked a peek at Brenda watching Jay Leno. He missed that, being able to watch her every move, her every facial movement. He had once had that privilege, he had the right to want to kiss her, he had the right to stare at her but he had lost that because he was an idiot. He desperately needed to talk to her but he also knew that once the silence was broken that all would be ruined. ""Well some things never change do they Miss Walsh?"" Brenda turned around to see Dylan leaning against the hallway closet door staring at her with a half smile on his face. ""What are you talking about?"" Dylan walked over to the couch where Brenda was laying and sat on the arm of it. ""I can see that you are still a faithful Jay Leno watcher"" ""Yea what can I say?"" The silence kicked in again. Dylan was surprised that Brenda didn""t bring up London and what happened down there but he knew that she would but he was just appreciating the silence while he could. Brenda rolled over to see that Dylan was out cold. She got up and walked into the kitchen and looked in the refrigerator to see what there was to eat.",29783
166,"""I wonder what""s with the snickers the other cooks gave me.."" she muttered. It was true that before she left the kitchen, the other cooks were snickering, even her aunt. ""You""ll find something amusing in the dinning room, Ayu. So don""t be too shock, okay? ""That was the parting words her aunt gave her.And it triggered her curiosity even more!She took a deep breath as she reached the door that separated her from the dinning room. Mustering all her courage, she opened the door.Nothing out of ordinary was here- save the large stage on the far corner of the room where everyone""s attention was focused.Everyone looked at the stage in silence, trying to analyze what Maya said.We are going to have a pictorial.Pictorial with Yuta as the model?Is the world going upside down?But you know...This is interesting, very interesting...""Um... do you want some sweets?"" Ayu inquired cautiously. They looked at her curiously.""Sweets?"" They looked at the cart and helped themselves with the sweets. ""Itadakimasu! """"I never thought that you all have a sweet tooth. I wonder how Maya-sama knew it,"" Ayu wondered aloud. They stopped and eating and looked at her as if she was an alien.""Maya-sama?"" Tsujiai repeated. Oh please, not that!""Yes. It was Maya-sama who ordered us to get these sweets,"" Ayu answered politely. She was quite confused at the expression they held.Maya ordered the sweets.Could it be that she also placed some of ""that"" potion in these delicacies?Not impossible.Uh.. oh..They all went to the nearest window and threw out the chocolates they""ve eaten. ""Wha-what are you doing?!"" Ayu gasped as she watched their actions. Are those sweets bad? She took one but Kaji slapped it away. ""We don""t know if these chocolates have poison in them!"" Kaji reasoned out. Ayu looked at her disbelievingly but she blushed a little. It seems Kaji is worried about her.But, of course, it could be because they were friends- nothing more than that. She shook the thought off. ""Are you crazy? These sweets were bought straight from the market!"" Ayu tried to giggle. She understood them fully, knowing how her mistress behaves. ""Are you sure?"" they inquired while holding their breaths. Ayu nodded.""Waaaaah! Those sweets were wasted!!!"" they groaned while Ayu giggled. ""Anyway, why are you keen about poisons now?"" Ayu asked. Before anyone could explain what happened, black curtains suddenly covered the windows, thus making it dark. The spotlight a while ago was focused on the stage. They looked at it curiously.Sebastian appeared out of nowhere and he handed each one present (even Ayu) a bucket of popcorn and soda. They looked at him curiously. ""What are these for?"" Mikami-sensei asked. Sebastian gave him the ""half-moon eyes. '""Isn""t obvious? You can eat while watching this pictorial prepared by Miss Maya,"" he answered curtly.They looked at the food suspiciously. What if this is a trick? All their doubts were erased when Luna started to eat her share.Well, Maya wouldn""t let Luna get hurt since she""s her friend. They started to eat.",560480

Orel then prays to God and says, ""God if this is the rapture please take me with you... or at least send the devil away...or summon those super powered girls from that one town.

178,"On the outside he seemed just as interesting as a block of flat stone. But on the inside, he was different. It might not look like it, but there was still a jumbled mix of emotions rolling around in Switch""s mind. Each one was practically screaming to be released. Only his powerful sense of reason stopped him from going truly insane. In the end, he was glad to know that his friends were supporting him no matter what. And even though he didn""t show this based on his expression, Bossun and Himeko somehow knew that he was grateful that they cared. [I will return. This business with Yuuki-san will be resolved once and for all. Try not to make a mess while I""m gone. And remember that the leader is fragile, Himeko!] Switch declared, before spinning around like a top and opening the door to the clubroom with astounding speed. He was already making his way down the hall by the time Himeko realized what he had just said. ""Hey! What""s with all those weird implications!"" she yelled as she waved Flagarance at Switch from just outside the clubroom door. ""Don""t go leaving after saying stuff like that, you coward!"" ""There he goes."" Bossun said with a cocky smile as he looked down the hallway right behind Himeko. ""I had a feeling he""d be like this. Switch has a way of telling us things without actually telling exactly what they are."" ""What do you mean? You guys passing secrets behind my back now?""

That""s been pretty obvious to me for awhile now."" Himeko grumbled before dropping down on the tatami mat. ""So you did figure something out the other night. Care to tell me why you lied about it?"" ""I can""t really say why. All I know is that we have to trust Switch about this. The virus on his computer isn""t a problem though. I""m pretty sure if he wanted to get rid of it, it would have been gone days ago. This is definitely something that Switch has planned out, and I think the best thing we can do is just leave him to it.""

""I don""t know what you""re talking about. It""s not like there""s anything for him to observe between the two of us."" Bossun said with a big smile as he waved his finger knowingly. He failed to notice the rising anger in Himeko""s eyes. Laughing loudly at his own statement, the leader of the Sket Dan looked at Himeko a second too late.",967934
1566,"Sora was a year older than Tidus, but age didn""t play a role in their budding friendship. That day was also when Sora felt his burden was lighter. Not only because Tidus had taken part of the burden on his groceries, but the blond had taken the burden of loneliness from his heart. That was how Sora knew the gang that was his circle of friends. Roxas, brother figure of Tidus. Namine, the mother of the circle and Vincent, the stolid father figure to all. They took him in, like how a younger brother takes in an adopted older brother with open arms and a warm, toothy smile. That was the day when Sora felt the sun had truly shone in his life. That was the day he was thankful for having lived. But everything slid to darkness when he came here. His friends disappeared into it. His light was overwhelmed by the nothingness that was creeping slowly towards his soul. He could feel it. Almost feel it. The earth was digging itself around him, almost ready to swallow him. The sensation of falling, getting ready to plunge into a pitfall that never ended. A hole that led to a world that never was, and never will be. Slowly... Slowly... Just a little more and everything will end... He could feel himself losing air...losing sight... A nice feeling to let go... A little more... Into a world where light cannot pierce... Where everything would truly disappear... Memories...soul...heart... Almost... Almost... ... ... ... ""MOOMBA!!"" ""Gah!"" Sora jolted up with a scream, fright reflected in his sky-blue eyes. A rather strong, childish voice boomed around him, drawing him from his melancholy and from his eager desire for a quick death. Yes...he was asking for death...sweet, maternal death...the embrace of a morbid mother...so dark...so hard and cold and... ""MOOMBA!!"" ""GAH!"" Sora was jolted up once more, finally standing from where he had lain. Alright, that was just pure irritating. Once, he can forgive. Twice is just foolhardy and annoying. Just as he was about to retort something nasty as to whoever was disturbing his ""alone-time"", he was greeted by a red, smallish, three-foot high, lion-cub look alike with a spiky mane, and wild green eyes. ""MOOMBA!!"" The creature took a long glance at Sora before it jumped back, clapping its paws and wagging its fire-lit tail. It was dancing and clapping at the same time, cheering ""MOOMBA!! MOOMBA!!"" over and over again. Sora would have asked him nicely to ""cut it out"" when suddenly the bushes around them erupted, revealing more and more creatures that looked similarly like the first one. The first one, recognizable due to be the only creature with a tail that was lit by fire, led everyone to a bacchanal revelry. Sora could only hear the same word over and over again, but he could feel...ecstasy and rapture in the creature""s voices. The three-minute fiesta finally ended with a pound on the ground and a quick somersault in the air. Everyone regarded Sora quietly, though some of them had a happy twinkle in their eyes.",583064
883,"""Sorry..."" Ed said while she was putting clean sheets on the bed. She looked over at him. He looked up, ""I just don""t like to talk about my old job is all."" He""d wanted to forget some of the last few years. Who could blame him? He still felt responsible for the death of Alphonse Heinrich, his brother""s counterpart in this world. Not to mention other deaths that happened during the attempted ""conquest"" of his world.

""Oh, that""s fine...Russel""s just keen on flying and the possibility of space travel,"" she said as she fluffed the pillows. Ed nodded, then looked around the room. On a desk, he saw a photo, and recognized Winry""s parents...Even they were the same. Odd. He picked it up, then smiled. Winry was a cute kid...To think instead of him and Al this one had grown up with the Tringams. ""Are these your parents?"" he asked, even though he didn""t have to. Winry stood up and came over, then looked over his shoulder. She leaned on his back, one arm on his sholder. He bit his lip...He could feel her chest pressed to his back. What was wrong with him? He never noticed things like that before. ""Yes,"" she said, her mouth by his ear. ""My mother died when I was still small...about a year after this was taken...My dad died a few years ago, during the war. He was a doctor, but he loved his work, and died doing it,"" she said. ""He and doctor Marshal, our local doctor in town, worked together a lot... but before all that, Dad had been the one who taught me about mechanics and such."" ""I""m sorry you lost them,"" Ed said, remembering the Rockbells. ""I""m sure they were wonderful people... But why are you so familiar with the church?"" he asked. ""Oh, well, I""ve spent a lot of time alone, and I go down so often its really like a second home."" she giggled, blowing breath against his cheek, ""A few people in the village actually call me ""Sister Winifred""...But I could never be a nun."" ""Oh, that""s good,"" Ed said, relieved, then he blushed, backed up, and looked at her, ""I mean...um...I mean, that""s good, because...Because you really should meet a nice guy and settle down, not be stuck in a church all the time- Not that there""s anything wrong with that!"" he added, waving his hands, and the picture still in one. ""Its just...From what I""ve seen, it might not be for you."" Why don""t I shut up already?! Winry""s face had been red the entire time, but now she laughed, ""Its alright... I""m still oung, I have plenty of time to think about it."" ""I agree with Edward,"" Russel said from the doorway. Ed and Winry both looked over. Ed frowned, and inwardly was ticked. That jerk had spied on them! He""d probably been there the whole time, listening in! ""How long were you there?""",512464
3460,"The crazy old man went around permanently dressed like a Russian cowboy; lord knows where the man first picked up his strange Western obsession. It was two years ago that the sadistic, monologue loving Russian had cornered Jasper and Edward in Seattle and tried to rape both of them. Luckily the evil old man was foiled in a giant battle that destroyed most of the city. The two of them were attending the tour of the dam when they saw an old man in cowboy duds who was hiding his face behind a newspaper. Jasper and Edward wanted to scream and shout for the tour group to leave; this was a dangerous madman on the loose. Before either of them could raise a peep, Ocelot pressed a button on the detonator he""d been holding in his hand. On cue, the roof exploded thanks to a series of pre-laid explosive charges that Ocelot had been careful to set up in advance. As an old spy, Ocelot knew how to lay a trap even if he did like to monologue for nearly two hours before the trap was set. People screamed as concrete was blown to bits and tons of the stuff came crashing down. Some shouted and ran while others were crushed under the rubble. Edward was nearly killed by a falling metal support beam. Ocelot didn""t mean to kill them this early in the game but he wanted to scare them and it had to be a tangible scare. Even a fake assassination attempt needs to look legitimate. Ocelot merely smiled while his prey choked on concrete dust and stumbled away from him. Grinning like a hunter, Ocelot""s long silver hair and pointed moustache glistened. Into his coat he reached for his single action Colt Army revolver. It was the greatest gun ever invented. Spinning his gun like Yule Brenner, Ocelot went after the two lost boys. Jasper and Edward tried to run with their eyes stinging from the dust and acridic smoke left behind by the explosive device. Their eyes also stung with tears of injustice. They always feared that the madman would return one day to take away their happiness. They went out armed always but it was Jasper who was the one that was good at not worrying. Edward""s gut was always in a knot for fear that either Alexander Anderson or Ocelot would return one day but at the same time he fed off his mat""s surety and steadfastness. Either of them could die tomorrow from a bus crash or cancer, Jasper always said. He was always much braver than Edward; Ed knew how to have fun but his husband was the one who knew how to live. Edward was willing to bet that Jasper wasn""t afraid of anything. From under his coat, Jasper pulled out a compact pistol. Since nearly being raped and killed by a pack of psychos both of the men were now licensed gun carriers. However, coming from the lone star state did nothing for Jasper against Revolver Ocelot""s almost magic marksmanship. A revolver shot thundered and blasted the pistol right from Jasper""s hand. His fingers stung from the impact. Reacting to protect his mate, Edward pulled out a concealed carry pistol of his own and fired back at their enemy; but Ocelot was like a ghost.",1220273
2130,"The glow was beautiful and it was specifically designed to shut down the logic and reason centers in the human brain; rendering all who saw it into dumb, obedient animals following a crude and evolutionarily obsolete god instinct. In the center of the brain killing light was an incinerated skeleton taller than anything human anatomy could support. The nephelim skeleton casually strolled through the gateway between the warp and the real world and closed the tear behind it. In less than a second, the charring on the skeleton went away and flesh and tendons regenerated. The emperor smiled as soon as he had a face, flexing his body to work out the kinks in his joints. Over his newly regenerated skin a kind of black body suit formed. He had no morals, nor regret or remorse or empathy but he did have a sense of modesty after all. Willing a brand new sword into existence, the Emperor clicked his tongue mockingly at Horus. ""You""re lucky I still need you, Horus,"" the Emperor chided gently. ""After seven years of death and destruction my obedient citizens need a scapegoat."" With a mental command, the golden throne lit up and the four bottles containing the prisoner gods vibrated. From the golden throne, invisible to any senses but those of the emperor, a stream of warp spawned power radiated through solid matter and space and shot into the heart of Horus. Last time, it was only an artifact of Nurgle that had tried to corrupt the leader of the Luna wolves, now the power of four ruinous gods would do the job. The fallen Primarch screamed as the chaos energy filled him and began to file down his soul to a nub. With all his might and willpower he could only delay the inevitable. His father smiled with great satisfaction at the pain his son was going through. ""Koschi."" A ghostly voice called out. Surprise momentarily flashed across the emperor""s face, too large for lies or deception; for a brief millisecond his eyes widened before he turned around and faced the ghostly apparition. The identity of the spectral caller almost made the Emperor laugh for the second time today. ""I don""t know anyone named Koschi, Eldrad."" There like a Shakespearean portent of doom, the psychic portrayal of the great Farseer watched the scene unfold with grim, dark resignation. ""It""s over, imperator. Everything has not gone according to plan, but this will do."" The Emperor turned away from Horus as the last of his son""s soul was eaten by starving gods. ""Please, no"" he sarcastically mocked, ""Tell me that the plan hasn""t turned out."" Eldrad just smiled and pointed an astral finger behind the emperor. The master of Mankind turned around just in time to see Sanguinius of the Blood Angels strike down a chaos infected Horus; chopping off his head and killing him. This disappointed the Emperor greatly as he was hoping for some good news feeds. Couldn""t have his son killed Horus when the security cameras were up and running again? ""My son,"" the Emperor said with a mix of false sadness and fatherly love that utterly fooled his winged son. ""It is over,"" he announced gravely.",1220273
432,"Ranma is dressed like Girlman but the costume is ""campy"", the mask, boots, glove, and cape are colored blue, and everything else is gray. Akane""s Tomboy costume is also ""campy"" and has green shorts and ""peter pan"" shoes, red uniform and a green mask. Ukyo then says, ""Hi Ran-chan, what""s with the goofy Girlman costume? Do you admire her too?"" Ranma then says, ""Well why are you dressed like her too but in a more psychedelic way? Ukyo then says, ""Well I admire the caped crusader and I thought it would be cute if I modified the suit... Well Akane, I see Tomboy has a fan too!"" Before the two can speak, the door explodes and they see what appears to be a criminal in a green bug-like mask/helmet, white mane, purple costume and cape, green boots and gloves, pantyhose tied to his mask like a bandana as well as his elbows and knees, and striped purple and black spandex. He has moths flying around him and has henchmen by his side who are dressed like him. The costumes criminal then says, ""Huh huh, I am ""The Killer Moth"" and I shall rob the proceeds of this party! Hand over the goods, now!"" The two henchmen look at eachother and one of them says, ""Daisuke, I hope this is worth minimum wage!"" And the other says, ""Well Hiroshi, the way this guy makes us commit crimes and dress like him, I expect a raise!"" Soun Tendo appears and says, ""Ok you! You will have to deal with me first!"" Then Killer Moth proceeds to fire his colorful cocoon gun at Soun and his covers him up in a cocoon, Killer Moth then says, ""Huh huh, who""s next?"" Akane then whispers to Ranma, ""Holy Breakin"" 2: Electric Boogaloo, Girlman! It""s that creep my dad told you about...The Killer Moth!"" Ranma then says, ""I know, and he""s got your pop too! Well let""s get out of those ""campy"" costumes and into our real ones, Lucky Kasumi got my signal and she is sending the Girlmobile over with our costumes. The minute Ranma and Akane leave the restaurant, Ukyo then says, ""I don""t see the caped crusader or the girl wonder anywhere...so I guess it""s up to me to squash that moth! He""s making me lose customers!"" Killer Moth then has the henchmen steal from the party goers and then he is suddenly slapped in the face by Ukyo""s giant black painted spatula and she throws a small spatula at his hand, dropping the cocoon gun. Then Ukyo proceeds to pick up the cocoon gun and fire at the Killer Moth into a cocoon, then she sees the two henchmen and she says, ""Boo!"" Then the two give everyone back the loot and they run off into parts unknown. Ukyo then grabs Killer Moth and he says, ""Huh huh, Please don""t kill me!"" Ukyo then says, ""I""m not going to kill you. I want you to do me a favor. I want you to tell all your friends about me. Then Killer Moth says, ""What are you? Because I know you""re not Girlman!"" Ukyo then says, ""I""M BOYGIRL! I""m just as bad as Girlman!""",910821
3657,"She crouched from a building top next to the decrepit complex, periscope optical function tuned to the wastoid guarding the door. She recognized Edwin Phillips from Gotham Academy. He""d been a fat kid with a big, fragile ego, and a Swiss banking father to back his every threat. The few years that had passed hadn""t been kind to him, making him rounder, his face more pinched and his red cheeks even more pronounced. A three-dimensional localization showed that Junior was several floors up. She heard a shriek, crash and shout. She caught sight of a pale flailing form, clinging to a pole, the remains of balcony railing. Batgirl sprung into action, engaging her propulsion jets and narrowly catching her as soon as the railing gave up on holding her. Even when they were safely on the street, the woman continued screaming like a banshee. Batgirl flagged down an awestruck pedestrian. ""Call an ambulance. Now!"" The woman she saved kept screaming. ""Miss, Miss you""re safe."" Batgirl informed her as the screams became sobs. ""Y-you have to help him- they tried to hurt m-me! H-here not going t-to-"" ""Miss, you have to remain calm. I can""t understand you."" The woman took a deep breath, and let out a ragged sigh. And she shaking relayed everything she could in under three minutes. ""Please, save him!"" She nodded affirmatively and took off for the apartment. What she found was the Ghost, Devon Brace, and his ragtag wannabe thugs. ""Well,"" she drawled, not bothering to hide her presence. ""I guess the meat fest is almost done."" All eyes- save a passed out Junior- went to her. ""Batgirl?"" questioned the Ghost. ""Batgirl?!"" Brace seethed. She smiled, and not a pleasant one. ""Is this an extension for Gotham Academy?"" Batgirl continued, jerk ingredients her chin at the insignia on Junior""s blazer. ""I""m going to have to see some hallpasses."" ""Shit, Brace, we need to split!"" one guy whined. Smart kid, she thought. ""We can take her!"" Brace brazenly declared. ""Oh, you can, can you?"" Batgirl sneered. ""Stand down kid,"" groaned the Ghost, ""This ain""t your fight."" He clamored to his feet near the balcony, uncoordinated, shaky and a whole lot worse off than Brace, or any of them. ""You should stay down, old man."" spat Brace. ""Or maybe you want me to keep you on your stomach?"" ""I don""t take orders from you,"" Batgirl snapped, deploying a restrained at the Ghost and binding him to the only intact wall in the apartment, ""and I definitely don""t do requests."" ""Suit yourself, Bat-ette!"" Brace laughed coldly. She narrowed her eyes and went at him. She fainted him with a punch and whirled to a body kick. He barely grunted and made a grab for her leg. She smartly threw her weight away, pulling her limbs out of reach. She bounced to her feet in a low crouch and frowned. ""Looks like you""re a sloppy dancer."" Brace growled. ""I can end this, and you!"" He charged and her and she danced away, kicking him with a kiss of her fist. He tried to grab her arm and she activated the takers. He hissed in anger and pain as his flesh took 300 jules. He lurched back and she smirked.",3439302
1869,"""This was just some plan to get me back wasn""t it? This was some plan to get revenge on me for kissing her isn""t it? God you make me sick"" Dawson released Pacey""s arm. ""No it wasn""t some plan. It just happened. Did you plan to kiss Joey? Did you plan to betray me? Did you plan it all Pacey?"" Pacey shook his head. ""Neither did I. Actually I never planned to fall in love with her the first time. I never planned to have these emotions for her. I wish I could make them go away but I can""t. I can""t stop loving her, because that means I gave up, and I""m not ready to give up on her"" Pacey began to walk away but turned back to Dawson. ""Her choice changed everything... it still does."" With that Pacey walked off not looking back to see the look on Dawson""s face. He just needed time. He needed some time to himself and then everything would be okay. Dawson watched after Pacey and then he turned to see Joey""s house. Her choice changed everything... it still does. Dawson ran up to Joey""s door and walked in to see Joey sitting on the ground crying, Dawson walked over to Joey and sat down next to her. Dawson looked over at Joey and felt a huge urge to put his arms around her, but he knew she didn""t need that right now, she needed to cry; she needed to let it out. To let it all out. ""So what do we do now?"" just like old times chapter 2 ""Just like Old Times"" Chapter 3- By Dannette Lawrence Summary: Dawson and Joey are getting closer and the same old question has come up again... should we give it another try? ""So what do we do now?"" Joey had barely caught Dawson""s question through her sobs, she was crying so hard and only half the reason she was crying was because of Pacey. She was mostly crying because of the situation her and Dawson were in, yet again they were brought back together. No matter how many times they told each other that it was over, somehow they were always brought back together and Joey was getting sick of it. She was sick of shedding tears over a lost love, she wanted it to be all over, she wanted the happy ending she so richly deserved, either it be with Dawson or by herself, she wanted the happy ending. ""I-I don""t know"" A part of Joey wished that she never made that phone call, because if she never made that phone call she would still be with Pacey and not miserable and heartbroken. Joey knew she wasn""t heartbroken over Pacey, they had fought so much lately, there had been so much tension and she knew it was only a matter of time until one of them would break it off and Joey had hoped it was Pacey, but in a way it was really her who had ended the relationship. She ended the relationship the minute she picked up that phone, she ended the relationship the second she entered Dawson""s room, she ended the relationship when she fell asleep in Dawson""s arms. ""Could you ever love me like you love him? Pacey was right, she never answered him, back then she didn""t know how to answer that question and she still didn""t. Dawson was everything to her; he was the best friend, the unattainable crush, the boyfriend, the shoulder to cry on... everything.",29783
1432,"""Still thinking about it, Kuwabara-jiisan,"" Hikaru answered. ""I""m still not sure I want to become a pro."" ""You""re acting like you""d pass it without question,"" Kuwabara retorted, before letting out a cackling laugh. ""I beat Akira fairly regularly, don""t I?"" Akira would have snorted, if his mother hadn""t been there. ""One in every five matches, maybe,"" he corrected. ""I wouldn""t call that regularly."" ""That""s better than any of the young pros, though? When""s the last time you lost to a lower-dan?"" Akira lowered his eyes, not willing to seem boastful. ""My boy""s never lost to anyone under a five-dan rating since entering the pro league!"" His father answered for him instead, punctuating the statement with another laugh. ""So what? Mother still beats me on a daily basis, and she""s not a professional."" His father cast a sly look at Kouko. ""She""s a very special lady. One in a billion - but that""s no excuse for not seeking to advance in the professional world. Most of the best players in the world compete professionally."" ""But not all,"" Akira returned. ""What about SAI?"" As soon as he spoke, Akira knew he""d said the wrong thing. He was sitting in a room with two of the very few people who might have a better idea of who SAI was than anyone else, but his mother had never done anything to acknowledge her tie with SAI, and Hikaru had never acknowledge he even recognized the name. The silence weighed heavily in the room, and Akira wished there was a way to take back his words. His father didn""t seem inclined to help, instead looking at Kouko with narrowed eyes. But she merely lifted her chopsticks, daintily eating a mouthful of rice. ""You know about SAI?"" Hikaru said after a long moment. ""I didn""t know you were into NetGo."" ""I didn""t know you were,"" Akira replied pertly. ""And most of the younger pros follow NetGo avidly, especially since SAI started playing regularly."" None of the Kuwabara family could miss the way Hikaru shifted in his seat, squirming with discomfort. ""Oh,"" he said, ""I thought NetGo was too casual for you. I mean, the games don""t count for anything..."" ""All games count,"" Kouko said softly, her eyes catching Hikaru""s through their sheer intensity. ""Every Go player""s game is changed by those they challenge, and they take another step on the road to the Hand of God."" It was really weird to watch his mother stare at his best friend like that, Akira thought, feeling a bit uncomfortable himself. He was the one who knew the truth, about how the two regularly fought over the goban. While he wasn""t convinced Hikaru was SAI, he did believe his friend had, at least, studied under that master""s hand. ""Playing Go online is a good thing, but it doesn""t match the real experience,"" Hikaru said. ""I mean, I like to watch the games SAI plays with KOUYO, but I get the feeling the games would be much better if they sat across the goban from each other, in person. There""s..."" he paused, tilting his head to the side as he searched for the words, ""an intensity that is missing without that challenge. I""m sure SAI would love to play against KOUYO for real.""",1112924
3722,"Joey took a breath. ""I have loved you my whole life, there is no doubt when I say this I still love you. My life is so intertwined with yours that sometimes I forget where I end and you begin and the last time I told you that it seemed like a bad thing, but I now realize that it""s the best thing about us. We""re soul mates."" Joey laughed. ""Never thought you would hear cynical Joey say that huh? I am going to tell Pacey what happened, I can""t lie to him. I won""t do to him what I did to you."" Tears rolled down Joey""s face. ""I love you."" Dawson finally made a sound once the tape ended. Dawson shut off his camera and looked down at his hands not knowing what to do. How could ""movie night"" turned out to be this? Dawson looked at his window and hoping to see Joey crawl back up that ladder and tell him she couldn""t leave. Dawson shook his head, why was he so stupid? Real life wasn""t like that. Real life wasn""t a fairy tale like the naïve 15 yr. Old boy that he used to be used to believe. There weren""t happy endings; he now knew that. Pacey and Joey taught him that. They taught him that first loves never lasted. Dawson had felt his heart break when he saw his best friend and the girl he loved kissing outside his house; he thought he could never hurt that bad but now he felt even worse. He was content where he was in his life, he had Gretchen, him and Pacey were beginning to be friends again, his mom was expecting another child... life was pretty good for him but then she had to call him. She had to ask him if they could hang out.... She had to sound so hurt when he said he was busy... she had to climb up that ladder... she had to look so beautiful when she was watching Scream 2.... She had to feel so good close to him... she had to look at him that way... she had to be her.... Why were things so complicated? Dawson all of a sudden heard Gretchen""s voice enter his head. ""Sometimes letting go isn""t the answer"" Dawson grabbed his jacket and ran out of his room and back down the stairs and out of his house. Mitch looked over at Gale. ""What in the world is going on?"" Gale shook her head. ""Love is going on."" Mitch opened his mouth to ask another question but shut it instead not wanting to know at the moment, right now he just wanted to drink his cup of coffee in peace, without complication. ""Pacey! Please!"" Pacey staggered back as he felt hot tears run down his cheeks, they felt like acid burning his face but he didn""t dare wipe them away, he didn""t know if he had the strength to. ""How could this happen? I was only gone a day, how could everything go bad in a day?"" Joey shook her head trying not to cry. ""Nothing happened Pacey"" Pacey laughed. Was he supposed to believe that? ""Something did happen Joey!"" Joey ran up to Pacey and shook her head. ""No Pacey! All we did was sleep! Nothing else"" Pacey remained where he was. ""That is something! Every simple little thing is a big something with you and Dawson! I knew something like this would happen if you two became friends again. I knew you two would eventually realize you two were still in love with each other.",29783
3495,"Both of them were essentially on athletic scholarships, here to show off their skills in their respective arts. Both of them hailed from rural parts quite far from Honnoji Academy, and came from families with little money. They were very similar, that much was true, but they were just rivals. Rivals interested in showing the perfection of the art of tennis and boxing respectively. Nothing less, nothing more. But the more Takaharu thought about it, the more it was becoming clear that perhaps there was something more than just a simple rivalry. And the very thought scared Takaharu more than he would admit. Having a rival who you were friends with was bad enough. But having a rival you had romantic feelings for? That was much worse. It was no surprise that Takaharu and Omiko remained silent next to one another, as they stood together and waited for Satsuki to make her appearance and announce the start of the Ensemble Escalation. They waited with the countless No-Stars in attendance, but it was no secret that for this particular round of the competition, it would be only those under Sanageyama""s Athletics clubs that would be allowed to participate. And out of those ten lucky No-Stars, Takaharu and Omiko included, the one who made it to the top of the Covered Conquest Tower, constructed specifically for this event, would be the one who would win the prized One-Star Goku Uniform for themselves. Of course, only one could win it. Gamagoori made that clear to all those in attendance as he began to speak. ""STAR-LESS PLEBIANS! BE AWARE THAT EVEN IF YOU MANAGE TO MAKE IT TO THE TOP, ONLY THE ONE STUDENT WHO REMAINS STANDING WITH THE GOKU UNIFORM IN POSESSION WILL BE GIVEN THE HONOR OF OWNING IT!"" His tone lessened, surprisingly, as he continued. ""Satsuki-sama has other matters to attend to today, so I leave it Sanageyama to formally announce the start of the event. I wish only the strongest, the best of luck."" Sanageyama seemed to take his cue almost instantly, smiling to himself as he cut across to the front of the waiting participants. In an instant, Takaharu and Omiko were down on their knees, ready to break into a sprint at but a moment""s notice. ""Well, as much as I miss Satsuki-sama""s guidance, it""ll be a nice change of pace to run things for once. I""m sure you""re all as ready as ever?"" he asked, though he knew the answer all too well. Omiko and Takaharu nodded in unison. Sanageyama grinned, happy to see that his two most promising hopefuls were primed and ready to go. ""Alright!"" he exclaimed, his jacket billowing around him as he put on a triumphant stance. ""IT""S TIME TO SEPERATE THE REAL ATHLETES FROM THE CHILDREN!"" the Elite Four member announced, in a display of enthusiasm and spirit that surprised Gamagoori especially. An aura of green fighting spirit blasted to life around Sanageyama as he crossed his arms, putting even the annoyed Omiko and Takaharu in momentary awe. ""As chairman and advisor of all Athletics clubs, I hereby announce..."" He raised his arms, and his fighting spirit seemed to flare up with them.",967934
179,"A sound comparable to a sonic boom could be heard throughout the outside hallway as Flagarance made contact with Bossun""s face, knocking off his Poppaman hat and sending it flying to the other side of the room. Shaking in pain as reached out to touch the huge red mark now stretching down from his forehead to his lips, Bossun could only look up from his kneeling position as tears of pain stained his face. ""What the HELL was that for?"" he screamed loudly. Himeko just gave him her piercing Yankee gaze, with Flagarance still poised to strike just above his head. Bossun couldn""t see it, but there was just a slight tinge of pink present on her face. She looked away, crossing her arms before giving him an almost quiet response. ""You""re just so annoying sometimes that I can""t help myself, leader."" There was a strange feeling in the air. It was something that Switch couldn""t really put his finger on, and it would be the death of him if he decided to admit that it was something of spiritual origin. He looked back at the old incinerator behind him with blank eyes. To think that such a relic could contain so-called spirits was ridiculous. But then again, so were some of his recent actions. Switch turned back around, and continued to wait with his computer situated perfectly on his lap. All in all, the last three days had been pretty ridiculous in general. Switch was absolutely sure of that. In the distance, he could see her approaching. Her long raven hair covered part of her face, and she walked with her arms outstretched. Her back was hunched over, and she looked like a zombie as she made her way next to Switch and sat down. The cold cement between the two felt like some sort of barrier, especially considering how silent Yuuki was. Switch""s head pivoted like a submarine periscope. He stared at Yuuki as he typed his words out quickly. Despite the giddy emotion he was trying to convey, his words were becoming very quiet and distorted. [So I see you got my memo. Bravo, Yuuki-san!] His attempt to lift the mood didn""t seem to affect Yuuki very much. Her response was quiet and more dead than usual, even for her. ""Shimada-san told me you wanted to see me here after school. So I came."" [I can see that.] Switch said with a laugh in his synthesized voice. [I must say that you look more beautifully dreadful than usual.] When his typing stopped, Yuuki turned to look at him, and then glanced at his computer. His synthesized voice was becoming so low that she could barely hear what he was saying. It was as if each passing sentence of his was becoming quieter than the last. ""Your computer..."" she said, her tone becoming suddenly grave. ""...I see that the curse has its final hold on you. I feel sorry for you, Switch-kun, but I am also disappointed. I expected more from someone like you..."" Then the occult girl laughed, her eyes glowing with ghastly excitement. ""It""s so strange. You""re finally on the edge of my world, yet something feels so wrong..."" [I am not surprised you feel that way.] Switch declared, before he stood up and suddenly became very intimidating.",967934

Brahm/Beatrix laughed even harder as Kuja fell back to the floor. Blood from his many cuts and lashes bled to the floor. Tears mixed with blood as he cried. Solid steel chains kept Kuja from moving freely around the cell. ""Zidane won""t abandon me here!"" Kuja spat out. ""He promised to save me, Brahm! Nothing in this world could stop him from finding me now."" Brahm/Beatrix grinned. ""But you don""t understand, Kuja. I want him to find you. Zidane will come for you, but he won""t be alone.

3122,"Thank you guys so much for pointing it out to me, and I""ll be much more careful with future chapters! :) So that""s it for this long author""s note! I hope you enjoy the rest of my story! Percy ""Can you walk?"" Percy asked, helping Annabeth to stand. She tentatively put her weight on her bad leg. That bubble wrap cast that they had managed to re-secure around her broken ankle popped a couple of times under the sudden pressure, but held, which Percy counted as a victory. Unfortunately, Annabeth cried out in pain and sunk deeper into Percy""s chest in order to remain standing. She bit her lip in irritation. ""Maybe... let me try again."" She pushed away from him, about to place her foot on the ground, but Percy held her back. ""No way. I can tell when you""re hurt."" Annabeth glared at him. ""I""m fine! We need to start moving! We can""t wait around here forever!"" She pushed away from him again and started to take slow steps. After a few, she fell heavily to the ground, clutching her chest. Percy ran over to her. ""Are you alright?"" he asked in concern. ""I- I""m fine,"" she said again, between pants. ""No you""re not."" Percy said. A small smile speared on his face. ""Well, there""s only one thing to do now!"" ""Which is?"" ""I""ll carry you!"" He stated cheerfully. ""Percy, that""s a stupid idea. What if we run into monsters? You won""t be able to fight!"" Annabeth protested. But, since she was unable to come up with a better option (or so Percy assumed) she held her hand out and grudgingly got on his back. She wrapped her arms around his neck, getting ready for the piggy-back ride. ""You""ve got the backpack?"" Percy asked. She nodded. ""Here, hold Riptide, so we can see where we""re going,"" he said, and momentarily let go of her leg to pass her the sword. She held it carefully in front of them, trying her hardest to maintain hold on Percy one-handed. ""Just keep walking forward until we hit a wall. Then we can walk around that and try to find an exit,"" she suggested. ""Okay. Are you ready?"" Percy asked. She gulped and tightened her grip, both on Percy and the sword, but nodded again. They walked a few minutes in silence coming across nothing. More time passed. Still, they hadn""t even reached a wall. Finally, Annabeth cried, ""Look, Percy! There""s something up there!"" He hesitated for a second squinting into the darkness. There did appear to be something ahead of them. It was hard to say what, but it was definitely different from rock, the only thing they had encountered so far. Quickening his pace, they reached it in seconds. ""Is this... the wall?"" Percy asked, gently laying his hand against smooth metal. ""Of course!"" Annabeth cried, Percy could tell she was mentally slapping herself for not remembering whatever tidbit of information she was about to tell him. ""Tartarus is a dark pit surrounded by a wall of bronze!"" Percy stared her. ""Seriously? We just saved Nico from bronze jar, and now we""re trapped in one?"" ""Well, it""s much bigger than Nico""s was,"" she pointed out. ""Just so it can be stuffed to the brim with monsters and titans!"" ""True.""",2943978
2528,"Barbara hadn""t acknowledged that she was still officially engaged to Gordon, and that sleeping with Renee was a betrayal of him. Barbara was the one falling apart this time, and Renee wasn""t doing anything to put her back together. It was not a healthy start to a rekindled relationship, and Renee knew that. Barbara""s cellphone phone rang at ten that night, as it had every night since Barbara had appeared on her doorstep. Barbara awoke to the sound, and Renee waited to see if Barbara would answer. As before, Barbara let it go to voice mail. She hadn""t returned any of Jim""s calls. Renee wanted to leave things alone, but her conscience had been weighing too heavily not to acknowledge the limbo they were currently in. ""Are you going to call him back?"" she asked, speaking into Barbara""s shoulder as they lay spooned together. ""I thought you didn""t want me to be around him. You were the one who said he was no good."" ""He""s not an evil man, but he""s no good for you,"" Renee replied softly. ""He""s going to get himself killed, and it would kill me to see you get caught in the crossfire again."" Barbara""s body shuddered. ""He""s out of Homicide now. Maybe he""ll play things a little more safely."" The silence that lingered between the two acknowledged the impossibility of Jim Gordon ever choosing ""safety"" over ""justice."" Despite his current assignment, Renee believed Gordon would somehow bounce back from this setback. The story that had circled around the GCPD about Gordon""s transfer out was pure gold, the kind of gossip that was too outrageous to be anything but the truth. Renee had suspicions that Sarah Essen had been the one to start its spread, subtlety revolting against Gordon""s fate as a scapegoat. ""He told the mayor to kiss his ass,"" Renee admitted, unable to stop herself. Barbara laughed, and Renee would have been relieved if there hadn""t been a half-hysterical edge to it. For lack of a better response, Renee turned Barbara""s body toward herself and kissed her. Barbara responded with all the eagerness of a drowning woman, clinging to Renee like she was a life preserver. Renee shut her eyes, and pretended that this time, they would last. If Renee pretended hard enough, maybe Barbara wouldn""t realize that she was rebounding from the man she loved. Even though Barbara was back in Renee""s bed, the ghost of Jim Gordon loomed between them, one of a hundred secrets they would never be able to talk about truthfully. Gotham was built on secrets, and knowing how to keep them. Renee would give everything she could to Gotham, protecting the streets and fighting the good fight. She would help Jim Gordon, becoming a cop that he could rely on. Barbara was her own person, and Renee hadn""t done anything actively to take Gordon""s fiancee from him. Surely Renee could be forgiven for stealing whatever happiness she could find. There were times when Gotham felt her true age, reminded of the caves that lay beneath the expanse of the Wayne Manor""s lawn, the caves that held the core of her existence.",1112924
869,"PLEASE REVIEW :-) NO FLAMES:-( There you go people another update for the ones who read this. NO FLAMES. Motor cross Buddy+ It took a week or so for the wound to really heal and there were some yells from the phone exchanged with brother and sister and friend and friends. It ended in Dawn winning again of course. She refused to move down to Miami with her brother because the only thing you could do down there is really smoke, drink, do drugs, dance, and maybe occasionally drive and race. But yeah she was still going to go on living with Dominic and Tej. She woke up Thursday morning feeling great and hopped out of bed putting on her flare out sweats and put on her old High school hoodi with the Blue Devil symbol on it. She walked out into the living room yawning. She looked over and saw Dominic on the couch watching T.V. while Tej was in his chair playing a video game. She chuckled at that because he had been at that game for about three weeks now. She walked over to the kitchen and opened the refrigerator door and looked in to find that it was almost empty. She found the milk she was looking for that thankfully was not stale and put it on the table. She then walked over to the cabinet and opened it up and then pulled out a glass and walked back over to the table and made herself a glass of milk and then just to make it a bit sweet put some sugar in it. She walked over the couch where Dominic was sitting and just collapsed on it. Dominic looked up and said, ""Mornin how you feeling."" ""Good just a little headache but that was just because of that damn drink I had last night. I think I might go to the motor cross track today and then swing by the store and pick up some groceries because we are out,"" Dawn said a she quickly chugged down her milk and then sitting it down on the coffee table. She leaned on Dominic""s shoulder as she watched T.V. ""You know I think I got one more level on this damn thing and I""ll be done and maybe I can come with you because I don""t trust you when you buy food,"" Tej said as he pushed the buttons on his game boy. Dawn stuck her tongue out at him and flipped him off. ""What about you Dominic what is your plans for the day,"" Dawn asked smiling up at him. ""I have to work on the car that way it will be ready for the next race. Oh by the way please take my bike that way you won""t have a wreck on that piece of junk you call a motor cross bike,"" Dominic said. Dawn just grumbled under her breath as she got up and went to get dressed. She put her hair up as usual to keep it off of her neck. She also put on her tight hip hugger jeans that looked all torn up and worn out. She walked over to her closet and picked out her shirt that looked torn up but was jut made like that and had the saying on it that said, ""Don""t Make Me Mad,' in red. She put on her black bra so that it will show threw her white shirt. She liked making boys drool over her. She grabbed her black shoes and slipped into them. She then grabbed her keys to her other car and her CD case.",806976
2843,"Taking him to the stupid movie will provide her with a good excuse for when Regina inevitably flips out at her. At least this activity is more appropriate than hatching another plot to break up a marriage. Someone chuckles, and she turns her head to see Graham standing next to the dartboard, absentmindedly rolling a red dart between his fingers. She raises an eyebrow challenging. ""Do you need me for something?"" she asks. Trying to keep her relationship on an appropriate level is a balancing act she hasn""t quite mastered. Strictly speaking, Graham is her boss and his flirting could be considered sexual harassment by some standards. But the attraction between them is mutual, and the employee handbook she was given on her first official day is going to be knowingly disregarded within the next couple of months. It""s frisson, the awareness of where he is and how he is and how much she wants to suck a hickie into the fine curve of his stubbly neck. She""s only human. At some point, they""re going to end up in bed together and what happens afterward will be typical of her relationships. That doesn""t mean she""s not going to put up a fight and pretend they""re ""just friends."" ""I""m working on the schedule for the next month,"" Graham says. ""Are you okay with working second shift?"" Schedules. She hasn""t held a job with schedules since she was twenty. Her acceptance of this post had been more of a function of her wanting to piss Regina off than for any desire for regular work and security. She hadn""t realized the details of being tied down to a regular job since she""s so used to freelancing and calling the shots herself. Second shift is the two to ten bracket. Henry""s school doesn""t get out until three. ""Day shift only,"" she tells him. ""I can""t work nights."" ""Oh,"" he says, and there""s a long, knowing pause. ""Any reason?"" She shrugs. She""s not going to admit anything she doesn""t have to. Graham may be cute, but she doesn""t know if she can trust him. ""You""re a deliberate mystery, Emma Swan."" He tilts his head in a fashion that draws attention to the column of his throat, and the wild impulse to climb him like a tree crosses her head before she ruthlessly suppresses her libido. ""I don""t know who you are."" ""I""m a hard worker who does day shifts,"" she replies, her lips curling slightly, keeping her posture pure and making an effort not to send him any flirtatious hints. ""We""ll see."" He pauses, before saying, ""I""ve already checked the sex offender registry. And I also checked on your criminal history."" While his tone may be playful, she realizes that he""s telling the truth. He did try to track her. She knows it""s hypocritical, but she really hates it when someone runs a background check on her. She does her best to keep off the radars, but there""s no way someone who is existing on the right side of the law can avoid having an electronic trail right to their doorstep. And her record isn""t entirely clean. Graham doesn""t deserve an explanation, so she fobs him off by stating, ""I work in a rough business. We get assholes trying to play the blame game all the time.",1112924
2329,"That had been her main argument against Bailey, but it didn""t matter because the argument was against Bailey. Even though it was a good argument as her bringing back Shepherd was doomed to fail. She saw this even more clearly now as she had another beer. You don""t send a person to bring someone back from the abyss who barely knows them; you""ll just wind up losing two people to the abyss. Especially when the person you send out is dealing with a divorce, a dump, and a confusing peds surgeon. Callie should""ve never been sent out into the woods. She was not a woods girl. Now, if had been Mark Sloan she might have been able to do something. In fact, why didn""t anyone think to send him? Fight or no fight, he was the best friend and this definitely fell into the best friend job category. There were so many who would""ve been better for this task. But as she cracked another beer and smiled slightly at his last comment and looked at Shepherd out of the corner out her eye, she realized something. She was beginning to know Derek, the man. Owen was aware of how much he was drinking. There was no denying that Shepherd""s words had affected him, spoken with just a little too much truth. He called himself a ghost and Shepherd had called him dead inside, which were essentially the same thing. It""s why he""d accepted the beer silently and commiserated with a different sort of comrades than he was used to, but he knew well enough not to drink too much. He was still a man on a mission after all, and he would not return to the hospital until he brought back Doctor Shepherd. He wasn""t lying when he told Bailey that he could, and he was determined to keep it that way. It was just taking longer than he expected. He needed to stay sharp and aware, ready to drive back. So he watched how much he drank. That, and, he worried about just how much of his guts he would spill to these people. Especially considering what happened the last time he got drunk. He wasn""t desperate to explain himself and secure a second chance (and another date) with Derek Shepherd; it was also why he got a different heartbreaking story. It was only thing to wallow over surgeries gone wrong, quite another to break down completely over surgeons and soldiers alike blowing up in front of his eyes. He wasn""t lying when he told Shepherd that he didn""t talk about Iraq either. He couldn""t afford to break, and being around a man who had gone over an edge he spent his life in the after flirting with as much as a certain resident was making this the kind of dangerous mission he once loved. So Owen Hunt watched what he drank. After the Chief followed Shepherd inside the trailer, Owen knew it was time to leave. He looked at his watch for the first time since arriving and was immediately brought to his feet by the time. He""d already missed Sloan""s face transplant, and would soon miss Cristina""s solo surgery as well. Damn it. He looked at his drinking buddy for the past few hours, she was looking out into the woods with the dazed stupor only the drunk and high could pull off. ""Torres.""",1497577
1777,"""Why don""t you tell us about it there lad? Talking about her might help."" Gimli nosily instructed while settling himself in hopes of a story. ""I do not feel only longing for her. I feel regret for what I had done to her."" ""What had you done?"" Pippin asked, Boromir swallowed, guilt rising in his every muscle. The hobbits knew little of love, they were too innocent to understand the desires and mistakes of man, but Boromir meant to please them in its knowledge. ""She is beautiful."" ""They all are."" Gimli criticized, the company glaring at him to shut him up. They then turned back to Boromir who continued. ""She gave me this cloth as a token. She had woven it herself."" Boromir spread open the purple laced square marred with dirt and torn at certain parts. ""I have kept it for long because it is my luck."" ""She gave it to you before she left?"" Sam asked, unconsciously licking his lips. Boromir looked around at all of them and shook his head. ""No. She gave it to me before I went to battle. I had met her in the market a week prior to the attack on the city Osgiliath, where more of Mordor""s forces were closing in on Gondor... Boromir smiled as he allowed his love, for now to her his friend, guide him through the crowded pathways of Gondor""s City. Her blond hair flowed down her shoulders like waterfalls and her pale skin glimmered in the sunlight leaking between the high towers. Her blue moonstone dress was covered partially by a black cloak which was tied around her neck, the hood hanging down the back. The sleeves finished from her mid shoulder to her wrists. Her nimble hand holding his battle-clad fingers and dragging him slog through the common people. He chuckled. ""Slow down Kierra, we have plenty of time."" She paused grabbing his other hand with her free one, in which he was given that glorious opportunity to stare into her milky blue eyes. ""I know, but I""m just so excited to show you my gift."" Her voice screamed eagerness and zealous opportunity, she then tugged him along again in which he frowned. They didn""t have plenty of time, in these few days he had fallen in love with this common girl, daughter to a wealthy merchant. If his father knew he would be expelled from Gondor, his father would not allow him to marry a woman of low birth, but she carried herself so godly. She had the beauty of a princess, the strength and determination of a queen... He loved her, but was uncertain whether or not she felt the same. He had to leave tomorrow, tomorrow he would head for the ruins with his army to fend off the Orcs who threatened to take settlement there. He did not want to leave her so soon, especially since he hadn""t told her yet. Despite his father he had full intentions of asking her hand in marriage... He just needed more time, time that was not plausible at the moment. ""So what exactly is this prize?"" ""It""s a gift not a prize. You""ve done nothing worth rewarding."" She teased, winking over her shoulder at him. He grinned brightly. ""Well what would you consider an achievement worth a reward?"" ""Perhaps seeing me more would be something I would reward.""",6234395

2918,"When the emerged from the staircase, Lilly peered into the room. ""Where is he?"" she asked. ""Straight ahead, talking to Will."" Nick pointed at their colleague Will Jeffried. The elderly, black detective was leaning against his desk, talking to a man who was sitting with his back turned on Lilly and Chris. Lilly narrowed her eyes. ""Isn""t that Gabriel?"" she said, confused. ""I thought he was still in custody."" Nick smiled enigmatically. ""Are you sure that this is Gabriel?"" he asked. ""Look closer."" Lilly was confused for a moment, but then something began to dawn on her. ""You mean this is..."" She trailed off and did as instructed: she looked closer. Right at this moment, the man turned his head, so that Lilly could see him from sideways on. He looked indeed very much like Gabriel. He had the same, handsome face and the same brown, graying hair. His brow was deeply lined, more than Gabriel""s, and his eyes had a different shape. But Lilly could now understand why everyone had mistaken Gabriel and Jamie for twins. With a few steps, she covered the distance between them and approached Will""s desk. ""James Jarvis?"" Jamie turned around. ""Yes."" Even his voice sounded like Gabriel""s. Lilly had to pull herself together not to simply gape at him. Instead, she stretched out her hand. ""I""m Detective Lilly Rush. I""m running the investigation. Thank you for coming."" Jamie got up and shook her hand. ""You arrested my brother,"" he said. It was not a question. ""I fear that""s true,"" Lilly said. ""There has been some evidence pointing to him.

""I see,"" he said. ""But we would like you to give an account of the events as well,"" Chris cut in. ""We need an official statement from everyone who was present that night.""

""Can you stop by tomorrow at ten a.m. to deliver an official statement?"" ""Will I have to testify in court?"" Jamie asked. ""Mr. Jarvis, right now it is very doubtful whether there will be a trial at all,"" Chris reminded him. ""It may be possible, but in that case we would of course inform you in time."" ""Alright.""

1612,"In the booth to his right, there was a family of five: a mother, a father, two little boys, and a baby. The dad was making goofy faces at the baby and the baby was chuckling and clapping her little hands together as though it were the greatest thing in the world. The mother was coloring with the two little boys, who had a coloring book and crayons spread out all over the table. They""d just gotten here. In the next one over, there was a teenage couple that appeared to be on a date. The girl had at least ten pounds of makeup on her already flawless face and the boy had braces and looked like a nervous wreck. They ate in nervous silence, watching each other very carefully. The next booth over had a group of women who looked to be twenty-something. They were all laughing hysterically at what a skinny woman with glasses had said about her boyfriend. At one of the tables, there was a group of grizzled-looking truckers with their plates piled in the center. They voiced their reluctance to be back on the road again and waited for the waitress to come and get the money. At another table, there was a group of guys that looked about Blackheart""s age when he was in human form. Something about them struck Blackheart as a little ""off"", but his opinion was not confirmed until one with shaggy blonde hair winked at him. He immediately turned back around, not wanting to give the guy ideas. You touch me, I will kill you, he thought, suppressing a shudder. He""d seen ""that kind"" enter Hell before. Mephistopheles had never ever told him whether or not it was just because they preferred their own gender or if it was because they""d done something else wrong. The rules concerning that were very vague. Even though Blackheart had never been involved in a romantic relationship (the very idea made him laugh), he was pretty sure he preferred women. He turned his head to look the other way. A young mother, probably not much older than thirteen or fourteen, was waddling towards one of the booths. Her belly said that she would probably deliver sometime soon. She looked very tired and sad. The girl""s mother came in shortly afterward. He couldn""t hear what was being said, but it sounded like they were arguing. They stopped just as a group of elderly people came in. It appeared that at least one of them was deaf and another one was getting senile because he was giving the waitress a hard time over something. When she walked away, obviously frustrated, the old man smiled. It had been an act. He envied every single one of these people. They all had places to go and things to do. They all knew where they belonged. Though they were simply links in a very long chain, they at least were content to live that life. Some of them would make a point of changing fate, yes, but a majority of them were content to walk the path laid out before them by the Almighty Himself. Blackheart had only seen God once, and if he""d had a soul then, he was sure he would have been badly frightened. Even a demon like himself had a hard time comprehending such a being.",870118
2411,"Meeting Miyazawa made me realize that they were truly perfect people in the world; it was as though she held up a mirror for me to see myself. I was afraid to look into it. Kendo was where I knew I had no competition. Even my sempai were unable to touch me when I truly brought my focus to bear. They didn""t understand why I was not more proud of my accomplishments in the dojo. They didn""t understand that violence was as natural to me as breathing. My triumph was of a more personal nature, keeping the temper I had never seen, but felt brim below the surface. Between matches, I would often touch the pleats of my hakama, hoping that through some weird form of osmosis, the virtues they represented would truly become mine. Still, balancing my duties was sometimes trying, and occasionally I""d need to take some time to myself, to recuperate. It was draining, at times, to be perfect. It was one of those days early in the term that I found the sakura grove. That early day in April, I managed to elude my usual followers, claiming I had some reading to do -- which was true, but it wasn""t reading for school. My father had given me a copy of Ogura Hyakunin Isshu, and I was looking forward to some time alone to read it. I liked poetry, though I had little talent at writing it. With my bento in one hand, and my book in the other, I took off across the campus, and amazingly, I managed to avoid people. I didn""t have a particular direction, so I let my feet take me where they wood. And that""s where I found myself in the sakura grove, all the way across the river. The trees were all in bloom, their pale pink blossoms scenting the air with the unique fragrance that so many people associated with the Orient. I stared up at the branches, marveling at the brief beauty that was so fragile, and so much a part of my culture. I shut my eyes and inhaled the rich aroma, and let it carry me away. This was the perfect place for lunch. I sat down and ate leisurely, flipping through the poems at random, puzzling over the phrases, and murmuring the ones that really struck me aloud. I smiled over a few, but most of them were melancholy. Leaning against the trunk of the largest tree, I set the book down and fell down into the fragrant grass. If there was a heaven, I would wager it looked very much like that sakura grove did that day. The time past quickly, and at some point I fell asleep. It was just so peaceful, and I believe I could have slept for an entire day, if I hadn""t heard the chime of the fifth period bells. ""Shoot! Fifth period!"" I murmured to myself, grabbing the jacket I had shucked off at some point. I raced towards the building, but I knew that I would be late to the science lecture, hardly the impression I wanted to make. ""I""m sorry,"" I apologized, and explained what had happened, knowing it wasn""t likely to pass muster. It was the first time I was in trouble in ages, but I still felt ashamed. My parents would be disappointed. The teacher wasn""t pleased with me.",1112924
1545,"""So, will you tell her that you like her too?"" she asked, breaking the awkward silence. I thought for a while. It""s not so hard to tell her that right? I mean, she already told me that she likes... Hey, she hasn""t told me that yet. Chitanda hasn""t told me that she likes me directly. So... how exactly do I do this?! ""Maybe? I don""t know. She hasn""t really told me that she likes me. Directly, I mean."" My sister produced a long, frustrated ""eh?' I ignored her and turned on the television. ""She hasn""t? My, then you have to tell her now!"" ""Now?"" ""No, what I mean is... you tell her right away. In that way, she""ll tell you what she really means directly! Right?"" ""Let me guess sis, shoujo manga or a television drama?"" ""T.V drama!"" ""I knew it."" That""s just my sister. Always getting her information on romance with mangas, flicks and dramas. And she tells me that I am a romanticist. Well, at least that get her mind off me. She went straight to the kitchen while mumbling stuff about that new T.V drama and I went back to my room. So... how should I tell Chitanda? Damn, I just can""t imagine myself doing the confession! Should I do it spontaneously... or formally? Damn it. Just, damn it. The next morning, I unexpectedly woke up early. Seriously, this love thing is turning my life upside down. Since I was pretty early, walking down to school is pretty quiet. Surprisingly, even Satoshi is early. ""Hey! You""re early today, huh?"" ""I should be asking you that question too."" Oh, right. I forgot to do something. I faced Satoshi and spanked him on the head. ""Owww! What was that for?"" ""For telling those lies to my sister. Because of you, she got me."" I replied with a hint of anger in my voice. Satoshi laughed apologetically and clasped his hands on the back of his head. ""Anyway, I am early today because I figured that this is going to be the most important day of your life. So I got up real early to help you."" He said bluntly. I crossed my eyebrows a bit. ""Gee, thanks."" I said with a heavy implication of sarcasm. Satoshi chuckled. ""If you and Chitanda become official, will you walk her home everyday?"" ""Probably. If she wants me to."" ""Seriously, Houtarou? Of course you""ll walk her home everyday! That""s like, official boyfriend duties!"" I rolled my eyes. That""s too stereotypical. ""Maybe you""ll eat lunch together! Ah, the thought of eating Chitanda""s cooking~"" I replied by just nodding. I never really thought about those possibilities. Such... tiring possibilities. Possibilities that I have to do, right? We finally reached school. We went through the shoe lockers, and then I went straight to my classroom. I sat down, not wanting anyone to disturb me. I think I""ll have to sleep for the whole day because if today is the day, then I have to conserve my energy. Who knew that romance could be so tiring? The update came in WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY too early... anyway, I just love Oreki""s sister XD Reviews are my inspirations! Yaaaaaaaaaaawn. Finally, classes are over. I grabbed my bag, and then gave another long yawn with a stretch.",2750536
2466,"Her heart is broken, but she""s more worried about what""s going to happen now that she""s gone and messed up her plans for an escape from the system. An ""accidental miscarriage"" would be the neatest solution, but Emma cannot bring herself to even think of the idea. Emma struggles to find the solution that will work. For so long she""s been promising herself that she was going to get out of the system as soon as she was eighteen, but her wings are turning into lead. There""s not going to be an escape if she has a kid. She knows all about the vicious cycle, and doesn""t want anything to do with it. But this is her child, and she knows what it""s like to be given away. She doesn""t want her baby to feel unwanted. It""s an unsolvable riddle, and she feels the walls caving in on her. Emma hides her pregnancy for a couple of months, but her morning sickness becomes so intense that her current foster mother guesses. Her social worker shows up the next day. Ms. Ulster simply looks at her, and Emma knows it""s time to pack her bags for another move. Usually her foster parents warn her, but Layla and Eric aren""t talking to her. Instead of moving into yet another foster home, she""s placed in a group home that specializes in pregnant teens. There""s eight other girls in it, and Emma pulls back into herself as her pregnancy advances, refusing to make any connections. Ms. Ulster visits the mandated number of times, but doesn""t actually talk to Emma. She always calls Emma ""Jane"" which is weird since Emma can""t figure out how you get to Jane from Emma. By the time she""s nine months along, there""s not a single part of her body that isn""t swollen, and she doesn""t know what""s going to happen tomorrow. She""s used to uncertainty, but she""s got a child growing in her and a decision to make. She""s survived for so long because she""s always only depended on herself, and now she""s paying for making an exception in her ""trust no one"" personal mantra. Giving birth is seventeen hours of pain, pain, pain. The medical staff are all strangers, and she is more isolated than she ever has been in her life. The sequence of events are blurry in her head, and nothing straightens out until her boy is born and she""s done delivering the afterbirth. A young nurse with pretty green eyes offers to let her hold the freshly cleaned child. Emma has made the decision to give him up, since keeping him would be a mistake for both of them, but she can""t resist the opportunity to have him in her arms just once. There are no words to summarize the amazement she feels as she studies him. He""s perfect, and she lets herself count his fingers and toes to make sure they""re all there. She holds her child and knows she still has the right to change her mind. She has three days before the adoption becomes irrevocable. She""s not going to, because a pretty baby boy is much more adoptable than a toddler someone else has started to raise. Emma won""t make the same mistake that destroyed her childhood. She doesn""t know what else to do with him, but can""t let go just yet.",1112924

3278,"Everything it touched was drained of it""s colors, and it was rumored that all people caught in the darkness became either monsters or animals. And the real monsters that emerged, those were horrifying. Black creatures that struck fear in all who were unfortunate enough to come across them. Meanwhile, men of all ages came to the castle, seeking the honor of being Hyrule""s champion. Many came to honestly fight for their land, and others came with hopes of riches, and still many others who thought the title would come with Zelda""s hand in marriage. And as all the men gathered, others in the land said it was useless to have such a contest. These people believed that the Hero of Time would come back again and save the land as before, but they were ignored as dreamers and fools. And any time Zelda came out of her rooms at the castle, she would be seen not in her usual bright dresses of pink and lavender and cream, but cloaked and her head bowed as if in mourning. She was in mourning. Every day brought more terrible news and every night brought the same nightmare she""d had for years, only now it was intensified, and new parts were added to it. Now, whenever the thing called Ganon laughed, the boy she held in her arms would disappear, and before her would be a ravenous wolf, reading itself to attack her. And more than once she would see an imp creature laughing as it rode astride the wolf""s back. Finally, a week passed, and her birthday came. The same day as the altered tournament. Zelda had refused to attend, but her father had looked so distressed when he nearly begged her to come. ""My dear, your sorrow and despair has spread to the people,"" he told her. ""They look to you, their future Queen, for courage and hope."" ""When this evil is so obviously a curse?"" she asked him. ""A curse that I am to be blamed for?"" ""That""s nonsense!"" he exclaimed. ""Who would tell you such a thing?"" ""It""s true!"" she cried. ""Because I caused Mother""s death! Because I am named Zelda! Because I have had only one dream and it foretells our doom!"" ""Dear, that is why so many men have come,"" he said, taking hold of her shoulders. ""They want to defend their homes, our kingdom- you!"" ""They only want the crown!"" she shouted. Her father did not shout or argue. He simply drew her close and hugged her. ""That may be,"" he said softly, ""But they must earn it. Someone will save us,"" he said to her. ""Perhaps... perhaps the Hero of Time will actually come and save us."" This made her laugh a little. If only such could happen. But her hopes were on the person Nayaru had said would come. ""He will be clad in green, and be one with animals...' ""Perhaps,"" Zelda said at last. ""Then come and watch,"" her father asked again. ""Maybe we will both see him, hidden in the contestants."" She grudgingly dressed in her old favorite gown and did as her father asked. She sat beside his seat in the royal box, and watched as the contestants lined up in their horses.",512464
1861,"Why was he thinking so much about it anyway? There was still a whole world of girls waiting for him, and he wasn""t Craven""s age just yet. Was he really ready to say that Monique was the greatest catch of them all? Unfortunately for Randy, his mind wasn""t given the chance to answer that question. The sound of someone knocking a heavy object over alerted him almost immediately, and he bolted out of his cot and up a flight of stairs towards the upper part of the Heat-Seeker. Peeking around a corner, Randy could see a dark shape moving around ahead. It almost looked as if it was rummaging through the equipment near the main controls of the boat, but Randy couldn""t be exactly sure due to the low lighting. Not once to take chances however, the hacker decided he was going to take matter into his own hands. Holding a flashlight in one hand, Randy made a daring leap at the intruder, and he actually managed to bring whoever it was to the floor. He wrestled against strength much greater than his own, but managed to get his light on the intruder""s face. All it showed him was the surprised face of Monique as she realized it was Randy that had actually overpowered her, if only for a mere moment. ""This is some sort of joke, non..."" Monique said in embarrassment, but Randy felt more amused by the situation more than anything else. ""It could also be a dream come true. I""m certainly not complaining."" Randy said with a grin, but his comment only earned him a strong kick to the stomach, which knocked him off Monique and onto his back a couple feet away. ""I would appreciate it if you didn""t interfere, Randy. Go back to sleep and...how do you say...don""t let the bed bugs bite."" she told him, but her command seemed to have the opposite effect, furthering a growing curiosity in him. ""I""m not sleeping anytime soon, you can be sure of that. "", Randy replied as he turned on a nearby light, revealing the fact that Monique had already put on a skin-tight scuba suit. ""You look ready to go for a swim."" he stated with a smile. ""I am doing what Dr. Tatopoulos should have done earlier today. I am going to find this mutation and do what is necessary. Unlike some of you, I have my priorities straight."" Monique shot back in a cold tone. ""Count me in then. I""m always up for monster hunting with a hot babe by my side."" Monique""s temper was beginning to flare the more Randy challenged her authority, ""You will only be a liability. Go back to sleep, Randy."" ""Oh, I""m not so sure about that. I wonder...Jefe! Somebody""s sneak-"" Randy attempted to finish, but Monique""s hand was over his mouth and he could feel her breath on his neck. ""You are not to say one word, understand? And in return, I will change my decision and allow you to join me."" ""That""s my girl."" Randy teased, but Monique grabbed him roughly by the collar and stared him down with a fierce look in her eyes. The color drained from his face, and his smile quickly disappeared, replaced by a much more worried expression. ""I just hope you realize that I have no obligation to protect you.",967934
1818,"Eddie looked really shocked and surprised that his own twin brother has this feeling of guilt, anger and frustration, but at the same time, feels a ginormous about of grief and remorse over the situation, because of the unknown. Crash panted furiously and just starts breaking down in tears, got himself down the floor and let out a few choked sobs. He got down to Crash and said, ""I""m sorry you feel that way. I-I didn""t even know that""s how you feel."" Crash looked at Eddie, in a very concerned and caring look that just makes him feel a little comforted. He told him, ""There""s nothing that you could""ve done. There wasn""t anything we could""ve done. And I know how much we both miss mom, because I miss her all the time. Do you even realize that every night I cry in my sleep, that I still have that memory rewinding in my head and it won""t stop until it""s stopped? I just feel helpless and trapped, just like you are. It""s like we lost someone so important in our lives and we can""t bring her back. You know, life just isn""t fair for us."" Eddie paused for a sec, as he continued to vent, tears were coming from his eyes and starts sobbing softly. He looked at his brother, in which there were tears coming out of his eyes as well. Eddie""s tears fell down on the ground, sniffled 2 times and continues, with his voice breaking, ""She came the only thing that happened to our lives and with her gone, it""s like... a part of our lives just left us behind and totally abandoned us. It gets me really sad and frustrated knowing that this happened."" Crash looked at his brother, as he watched him break down crying and then, comes in to hug him. Eddie started sobbing on his shoulder and Crash whispered, ""I""m sorry I blew up on you."" ""It""s okay. I understand."" Eddie said, tearfully. Eddie feels a tear coming from his eye and Crash wipes it for him and they looked at each other and said, ""Look at us. We turned out okay without being mauled by a few creatures, not even ugly sloths."" Eddie starts laughing while he was wiping his tears from his eyes. That joke really made him smile and it was Crash smile too. Then, he told Eddie, ""Maybe some ugly sloths, like Sid will be a good example to scare away dangerous creatures."" ""Yeah, I know, right?"" asked Eddie. They smiled at each other and started laughing with each other, like they""re really here for each other and they understand where which one is coming from. They do miss their mother, but they""ll have a little piece of her that stays in them. Crash chuckled softly and they looked at the sun coming out. Then, they smiled at the sky and realized that their mother is smiling down on them. Eddie told him, ""She must be happy for us that we""re here for each other."" ""Yeah, and as long as we""re together, everything""s cool."" Crash said. ""Brothers?"" Crash looked at Eddie""s fist, waiting for a pound and he smiled and said, ""Brothers."" Then, he reached for Eddie""s fist and touched it as a knuckle-touch. Then, Manny comes in and said, ""Morning, guys."" ""Hey, Manny."" they said, in unison. ""How long you guys been awake?"" ""Not long."" said Eddie.",1276465
831,"The vampire""s voice was calm, measured and smooth voice with a strange, musical accent. ""Are you awake, pale one?"" The vampire was handsome, almost as much as D. But this vampire would never have droves of women jumping at him. More likely he""d scare every woman he came across with his psychotic eyes, Cheshire cat grin and maniacal expression. He looked like he was pure evil. The style of the vampire""s clothing was odd, a long black coat, shiny black boots, top hat and black and white polka dot tie. Other than his tie, the only white on him was from his cotton gloves. Asenath backed away from him, she had a unique immunity to vampire bites but she didn""t want to risk him digging those huge chompers into her hide. ""Who the hell are you?"" The vampire strutted forward, ""I""m the guy that fixed your hand. If that doesn""t satisfy you, I""m the King of the Nobles. Greetings and salutations."" He reached out to shake Asenath""s hand but she shrunk back further. ""What the hell do you want?"" Dracula smiled, his facial expression sent shiver up Asenath""s spine, ""What do I want? I only want a little company. I""ve been very lonely for the last two hundred years."" Asenath sneered, ""You want to use me."" In his gentlemanly voice, ""I don""t want to use you, I only desire your consenting company. Besides, it looks like you could use the money."" She frowned, ""What are you talking about?"" ""Well, I saw an atomic bike outside that looked like its tires had been slashed by a sword."" Asenath seethed, ""D!"" It wasn""t enough for him that he""d humiliate and used her; he had to total her bike as well! She never paused to consider that it was the vampire who had dealt the damage to her bike. Dracula pretended to be shocked, ""D, you mean the famous hunter, he was here?"" Asenath snarled, ""Yes, that baby raping sack of shit was here. I wish he was still here so that I could fucking castrate him."" The King of Vampires nodded, ""I know what you mean. D has also done me a great injustice as well. He killed somebody very close to me."" Asenath had little time for the complaints of a vampire, ""Cry me a fucking river. I""ve got my own shit to worry about."" Dracula folded the bill in his hand, ""Since we obviously both hate D, I propose a partnership."" The chesty girl was surprised; a vampire proposing a partnership with a human was unheard of. So was a vampire bandaging a human""s hand. ""What""s in it for me?"" Dracula had a grin on that could kill newborn babies, ""Why my dear, you are a scorned woman. I know just as well, a girl such as you would be very useful against the abomination that is my dear son. He humiliated you terribly...surely you want to retaliate?"" ""I want to destroy him!"" Dracula clapped his hands like an excited toddler and giggled hysterically, ""Good, very good! But first."" He trailed off and placed the bill into Asenath""s cleavage. The girl sighed, she had long gotten used to the feeling of guys sticking money in between her breasts but she never enjoyed it. ""What do you want?"" ""Only thinking of me, how thoughtful. Do you do pony play?""",1220273
2662,"Jenny came up a little later to refill her drink, she started immediately needling Mira, ""Well, how is Fiore""s second prettiest model?"" ""I was just about to ask you that, Jenny."" Mira responded with a smile. She nodded to the empty glass in the frowning model""s hand. ""Can I refresh your drink?"" ""Yeah,"" Jenny handed Mira the glass. Mira began assembling a new drink for her rival. Jenny turned to face the table she""d been sitting at. ""You know, sometimes I miss having Laxus in our guild."" Mira""s hands stopped scooping ice for a moment before she forced herself to keep going. ""I always wondered, how did Laxus end up in your guild anyway?"" Mira hoped her voice didn""t betray her interest. Jenny didn""t act any differently, answering, ""Master wanted a good-looking bad boy in the guild. With his scar, tattoo and reputation, Laxus fit the description perfectly, so we recruited him."" Mira set down the finished drink by Jenny""s elbow, ""It didn""t have to do with the fact he was a powerful S Class Mage?"" ""That didn""t hurt, but no, it was the whole bad boy thing."" She looked over at the lightening dragon slayer. ""You know, I never did get a chance to sleep with him while he was in our guild. Bet he fucks like a stallion."" The smile didn""t leave Mira""s face, but her nails dug into her palms. ""I wouldn""t know."" Jenny grinned, and glanced back at Mira, ""Well, I""ll find out tonight and let you know."" As Jenny walked back to the table, Mira said through clenched teeth, ""Good luck with that."" Laxus wouldn""t sleep with her. Yes, Jenny was beautiful. And yes, they weren""t in any sort of official monogamous relationship, but still, he wouldn""t do that. Right? Right? Mira tried to put it out of her mind, but her eyes kept drifting to where Jenny sat next to Laxus. She laughed too loudly at his jokes and put her hands on his arms, eventually leaving them there, causally wrapped around his bicep. Laxus didn""t seem too interested, which may have comforted Mira if not for the fact that Laxus never looked interested in anyone. Even around her, he always acted cool. It bothered her all night, despite her best efforts. But she managed to keep it together. Until out of the corner of her eye, Mira saw Jenny moving closer to Laxus. She put a hand on his chest and whispered in his ear. Mira slammed a hand down on the bar and yelled, ""Jenny, get your hands off of my man!"" The guild went silent as everyone turned to where the Blue Pegasus mages were sitting to see what man Mira was referring to. Jenny smirked at Mira, leaning into Laxus further, who looked as surprised as everyone else at Mira""s outburst. Freed and Makarov reacted at the same time, ""What?!"" Freed turned to Laxus, ""Why didn""t you tell me? How did I not know?"" This triggered Evergreen and Bickslow to wonder the same thing. What kind of faithful bodyguards didn""t realize their fearless leader was dating someone? Makarov, on the other hand, yelled at Mira, ""Why would you pick him? You could do so much better, Mira."" Mira""s eyes hadn""t left Laxus"" though.",1497577
1097,"I journeyed with the other ghosts you encountered here, to Tartarus. Soon though, I started to question my choices. I have sworn to help anyone I could, how could I now pledge allegiance to Gaea and kill multitudes of people for the sake of my petty revenge? No. I may not have been able to take back my choices, but at least I could help you two escape."" Percy stared at the guy, not sure what to say. ""Well... thanks,"" he finally managed. Asclepius smiled. ""No thank you for putting me back on the right track. If we had not encountered the two of you, I still may have been intent on only revenge, you two have reminded me of myself. For that, I am in your debt. Now come. Being dead, I can sense the Doors of Death. They call me to them. I can lead you there."" Not knowing what else to do, Percy looked to Annabeth, who nodded, They both followed the ghost farther into Tartarus, but hopefully closer to getting out. A/N There! Finally done! Did you like it? Please tell me what you thought. I want to thank you guys for the amazing amount of support this story has gotten, please continue!

(I""m one of them, so I do deeply apologize, but I really have no time!) Jason turned to Piper. ""I""m going to fight them in the air,"" he told her. She nodded and pulled out Katoptris. She looked nervous. Jason didn""t blame her. Her... talents wouldn""t be very much help in this situation. And, with what happened to Percy and Annabeth the reality of what they were facing had slapped all of them. How easy it would be to fall in battle; just one lucky hit from the enemy and you were dead. They""re not dead yet! He reminded himself angrily. Still, his hopes weren""t high. Even though he knew how strong Annabeth was and even though he""d heard all the stories about Percy at Camp Half-Blood, Jason still found it hard to believe that anyone could survive Tartraus. Well Nico, had, or so he claimed. It was yet another reason why Jason found it hard to trust the son of Hades. He stole another glance at Piper and prayed to all the gods that she would stay safe in this fight then he jumped over the edge. In a second, he was flying through the air. The Venti were swarming the Argo II.",2943978
96,"Would he like the picture, she wondered. She wanted to make him something to remember her by when he left to follow his annoying brother to Canada. She merrily went on enhancing the picture, spreading glitter and bubble stickers onto the 8""x 11"" red construction paper on which she""d glued the picture. She frowned when a shadow fell over the image. Looking up, she saw it was a baby blue haired girl who had transferred in two weeks ago, and declared Pucca was her ""rival"". Pucca didn""t know what the word meant, but by the blue haired tormentor""s actions, she knew that it wasn""t synonymous to friendship. ""Hey, Poo-caaa."" ""Hi, Rim-Rim."" Pucca beamed. The blue-haired girl""s face turned red. ""It""s Ring-Ring, bun head!"" She glared at Pucca""s carts and craft masterpiece. ""Aw, isn""t that precious... For your boyfriend?"" Xavier was her friend and her mom said he was a boy so he couldn""t bathe with her, or stay in the same room as her when she changed her clothes... ""Yep!"" she happily replied. Ring-Ring frowned. ""Well it""s ugly. He""ll dump you in a heartbeat, if he sees that ugly mess."" With that she trotted off to go ""flirt"" with the other boy kids, whatever that meant. To be honest, it looked like she needed to go potty with her rocking back and forth like that. The school day came and went, and it was pick up time for all. Clutching her masterpiece, she waited for her mother to arrive. Reporters stood on the outskirts of the school, waiting like her pet iguana-Destiny-for her meal. Finally her mother did show. ""Pucca, dear! Over here."" She skipped over, happily, until something yanked her back the moment she reached the center of the reporters. ""Pucca-"" ""Hey, Pucca-"" ""Pucca- Princess-"" ""Pucca, over here-"" ""Give us an exclusive, darling-"" ""Sunshine, tell us your secret!"" Pucca was scared stiff. Close to tears she dropped to her knees on the concrete. And began to cry. Right there, in front of a dozen cameras and a few video recorders, she cried her heart out. End Flashback Garu""s POV: I watched as Pucca clung to Xavier like he was her life line. And in some ways, I guess he was. I reluctantly reflected on all the times I had ignored Pucca when we were kids. From hiding in a den of lions and ducking out at the slightest mention of her name, to flat out running from her. Understandable, that I could have told her I didn""t like her that way, but I had taken a vow of silence when I was seven after being pantsed by my cousin, Rin-Shin. And even when she""d done all she could for me; defeating my enemies when they tried to kick me when I was down, giving me coupons to her uncles"" noodle restaurant for free, getting me flowers that ate me and my friends- okay the last one was not so good. But she""d saved us afterwards. And gotten rid of the flower. And all without complaint or whining. She was awesome that way. If I lost her to a guy who could pamper her then I deserved it. I mentally pummeled myself. What was I thinking? This wasn""t the way a ninja thought-the way I, Garu Hong, conducted myself.",3439302

""What kind of feelings?"" he pressed, as he turned his head to sideways to look at her. Though Mikasa""s gaze was still on the sink. ""The same feelings Armin felt for Annie."" Mikasa answered, as she turned her head sideways as well to face Eren. Much to her surprise, their distance wasn""t that far, and their current distance was awkwardly close. Dangerously close. Eren didn""t say anything nor did he move. He simply stared at Mikasa""s eyes, as if telling her something. Unbeknownst to the two childhood friends, their other friend had already left them alone after wiping the tables. Though there was another presence peeking by the kitchen""s doorway. Squad Leader Hanji peeked at the kitchen""s doorway carefully, not wanting to be seen. She was looking-more like observing the two soldiers who were currently in an awkward position. Hanji""s train of thought was disrupted when she felt someone behind her. ""What the hell are you doing, four-eyes?"" Levi asked, arms crossed. ""I""m doing a recon."" Hanji replied, as if the answer was so obvious. ""We only recon on titans, not on two hormonal brats trying to unravel their sexual tensions."" Levi said as he scrunched his nose, probably in disgust with Hanji""s creepiness or the two cadets"" little moment. Either way, Levi found the two quite weird. ""That was oddly specific. Anyways, look how Eren is trying to figure out what to do next. So adorbs!"" The brunette squad leader retorted, peeking back at Eren and Mikasa. ""That""s it. You creep me out. We""re going back. Erwin said we""re having a meeting."" The corporal said as he grabbed Hanji""s collar and dragged her towards the exit. ""Using the chatroom, right?"" she asked, not minding being dragged. ""That""s what he wanted, yes."" ""Then let""s go~!"" And with that, the two superiors fled the scene and once again left the two soldiers to their business. OMG what is Eren going to do?! I""m sorry I""m such an EreMika shipper ;A; They""re kinda my main ship as of the moment so I can""t help iiiiiiiiit. Don""t worry though. I won""t smother you guys with fluff. This fic""s main genre is humor and I plan to stick with it. (But still! EreMika tho hnnnnnnnng) Anyways, so as Hanji said, it""s time for the superiors to have a chatroom of their own! I wonder what they""ll talk about. Hihihi. You guys might want to leave a suggestion for any of our characters"" topic in a chatroom! I would love to hear from you~ Anyways, see ya""ll at the next chapter. Peace out! Hey doods! Happy Halloween ;) I gotta admit though, this chapter is full on EreMika. So I inserted chat messages that would add some comedic content~ And I must say, Eren is a bit out of character. I did my best to make him stay in character though... So uh... hope you enjoy this oh-so weird chapter. Eren and Mikasa stood in front of the sink, both just looking at each other and not moving nor saying anything.",2750536
