1536,"Yves laughed. ""I""m just up to my ears into work. Was just studying an essay about the works of Salvador Dalí; gotta play an art college student for a few weeks. Don""t ask me; it""s a new job."" I promised I wouldn""t interrogate her. ""Where are you?"" I asked. ""New York,"" she answered, and my heart leaped into my throat. ""Really? So am I!"" I burst out. ""Are you?"" Suddenly there was an (ever so light) edge in her voice. It sent little icicles sliding down my spine, and I wondered if I had said anything wrong. ""Yeah, I am,"" I answered. ""And, hey, why don""t we meet up tonight? Have a few drinks somewhere, talk a little?"" ""Well, yeah, maybe,"" she said. ""But I can""t guarantee. I""m leaving town tomorrow afternoon, and I""ve got loads of stuff to do before that. So I really don""t know if I""ll have the time. I""d rather say no, Jimmy. I""m sorry."" My world was crumbling, but I didn""t want her to notice even the slightest thing. ""Well, ""twas just a thought,"" I said. ""After all, it""s been a while. And I was just thinking it would be nice to see you when you""re not, uhm, completely drunk."" Yves laughed. ""Well, you""re right, that""s a good argument,"" she said. ""But honestly, Jimmy, I don""t think it""s gonna work. And I""m sorry, but I gotta hang up now. Don""t have much time."" Every fiber of me wanted to scream, ""Please don""t! "", but the last thing I wanted was Yves thinking I was running after her. If she didn""t have the time to see me, then that was that. I should just accept it. But going on without having sorted things out... I knew that if I couldn""t talk to her soon, and in person, that night would haunt me forever. And I just couldn""t cope. I needed to know. But how could I tell her without creating the impression that I was desperate? The most important thing now was not losing her. If that meant that I simply had to ignore what had happened between us, then OK. But still... there had to be a way for me to let her know I really wanted to see her without scaring her away. ""Jimmy?"" Yves asked. I winced. I hadn""t noticed that I had remained silent for quite a while. ""Still there,"" I said. ""Listen, I really gotta hang up now,"" she said. ""I""ll call you tomorrow, that okay? Maybe I will after all have some time to spare for you."" ""That would be great,"" I said. ""You still have my number?"" Yves hesitated for a moment, then she said, ""Well, yeah, somewhere. But why don""t you just give it to me one more time? I""ll write it down."" ""Alright."" I dictated my cell phone number and my landline, and I heard her pen scratching over paper. ""Got ""em,"" she said. ""I""ll call you tomorrow."" ""I""ll make sure I""m available,"" I promised. Yves laughed silently. ""Good to hear from you, Jimmy,"" she said. Suddenly there was a lump in my throat, and I swallowed hard. ""Yeah, you too,"" I said. ""See you around."" ""OK. Bye, Jimmy."" ""Bye."" I remained there with the receiver in my hand even after she had hung up, not knowing if I should feel relieved, depressed or excited. Now I had finally reached her, but was I now wiser than before? I waited and waited.",240213
2179,"Kagome opened her eyes, and dismayed. Not just Kouga, but now a second wolf-man had appeared. And they were fighting! As she watched them brawl, she noticed that the second monster didn""t look like Kouga. He had no tail, for one thing, and he wasn""t covered with fur. But he did have two fuzzy ears on his head. Then, she the moon shone on the two, the second, white maned beast""s hands grew long, sharp claws, and as he growled, he barred a set of ferocious fangs. ""Oh great,"" Kagome said, ""Instead of one mutt""s plaything, I""m gonna be another one""s dinner!"" The white one lunged, and buried his teeth in Kouga""s neck. Kouga""s face went white with shock, then his eyes glazed over, and rolled back in his head. His body went limp. The white haired creature dropped him, and spat blood from his mouth. Kagoem stared it as it rose to its feet. It walked over to her, and leaned over her. She winced, waiting for the chomp. It never came. She felt two arms pick her up, and lift her up off the gtound. then, she heard a slight whimper. It was coming from the creature. She looked at his face, and saw concern in his golden eyes. He was worried about her. ""Oh..."" she said. ""You... you""re not vicious at all, are you?"" He shook his head. Then sniffed at her, and licked her cheek. ""Stop,"" she laughed. ""You were helping me, weren""t you?"" she asked him. ""Uh huh,"" he answered her. Unbelievable! He could talk! ""What""s your name/"" she asked him. ""Huh?"" he asked, tilting his head. ""My name is Kagome, and yours is...?"" ""Inu-yasha,"" he said with a bright smile on his face. Kagome giggled. ""Okay then, Inu-yasha. You think you could take me home, now?"" ""Huh? Home?"" he asked. ""Yeah, were I live. It""s that way,"" she said pointing to the east. ""Home,"" he said sadly. ""Oh, Don""t you have a home?"" He looked down, his eyes wide with sorrow. ""Father gone. Serenity gone. Joegore gone. Home gone. Where home?"" ""Wow. Well, uh... you could come home with me? I""d have to hide you from my grandpa, but..."" ""Yes!"" he answered. ""Okay,"" she said, ""It""s over that way. Let""s go,"" she said, ""I""ll give you directions. ""Right,"" he said. ""Home."" then , he started walking. AN: Will Inu-yuasha find his way home? Will Dr. Yami and the others find him before an angry mob does? Stay alert! Yami, Serenity, and Joegore scoured the countryside looking for their lost pet. Yami led with the lantern, Serenity squeaking a chew toy, and Joegore carrying a large butterfly net. They looked in the woods beyond a castle, they looked in dumpsters through out the town, and finally they searched the graveyards, where they looking gin every open grave and mausoleum. ""Where could he have gone?"" Yami asked aloud as they looked about the mausoleums. ""Well, he aint in this one,"" Joegore said as they closed a the heavy door. ""there""s the last one."" he pointed to a rather large stonework building. ""I""m not going in there!"" Serenity cried, holding on to Yami. ""Why not?"" Joegore asked. ""That belongs to the mayor""s family..."" Serenity said, shivering.",512464
1507,"So, Percy set off again, making sure to keep the wall on one side of him at all times. After a few more minutes, Annabeth stopped him again. ""Percy, wait! Is that my knife?"" She cried pointing at something lying on the ground. Percy stooped over and picked it up. It was indeed her knife, the only object he hadn""t recovered when exploring the cavern before. ""Oh thank the gods!"" Annabeth said. (In Percy""s opinion, she was way too excited about a knife, but it had been with her since she was seven.) ""Here,"" she said, capping Riptide and handing it back to him. ""My knife gives off just as much light and it""s a lot easier to hold."" Once again, they continued, making slow progress along the wall. Percy wondered about what Annabeth had said. Was it possible that nine days had already passed? If it was true, the others might already be at the other doors of death, fighting for their lives. And we still have to make it past tons of monsters and Gaea""s supporters to reach them! Plus, he had no idea how they were even going to find the doors of death. Unless Hades had installed one of those helpful ""you are here"" maps like in malls, getting lost was pretty much inevitable. And then there was the problem that Annabeth could hardly stand, let alone fight. It would be hours more before the ambrosia kicked in enough for her to even walk without pain. He had to find a way to heal her, preferably soon. A horrible cry suddenly brought Percy out of his thoughts. It was like the voice of a woman, but not quite. He had it before, but where? In the moment it took him to place it, Annabeth had already frozen against his back. ""Arachne,"" she whispered, terror clear in voice. ""How? When I saw her I think she was almost dead. She was hardly moving!"" Percy told her urgently. ""She must have survived and found a way to get out of the trap!"" Percy glanced behind him, at Annabeth""s face. He really didn""t want to fight anything with her like this. If anything happened to him, they would never get out of this alive. ""But she doesn""t know where we are, right?"" I mean if we keep quiet..."" ""She can sense me. I""m a child of Athena, she can sense all of us."" Percy ran. Any thoughts of how tired his legs were flew out of his mind. He thought he could hear a scratching following them, like a spider running along a metal wall. It might""ve been his imagination. He hoped it was his imagination. The sound kept getting closer, growing with every step he took. Finally, when he thought his lungs would burst, he saw something in the ground in front of him. As they neared it, he saw it was a hole in the floor. A faint glow of light was coming out of it. Hoping that that meant it lead to something, the second he could, Percy leapt into it. He hit something hard and stumbled, but managed to keep his balance. Throwing a quick glance around, he saw that they were it a tunnel of some sort. Torches lined the walls. The sudden brightness hurt his eyes, but he refused to close them.",2943978
3399,"He had been watching her using her magic in every way a foolish person would and then she tried to defend herself and went unconscious. He brought her here because he couldn""t control himself. ""I am your soon to be husband."" It was odd that even through all the hatred he had for the human race, he still held interest with this young girl due to how she looked. ""Fiancé? I barely know you. I have no boyfriends, or-"" He shot forward pressing his lips to hers, reaching his hand up to hold her chin and caress gently. ""My real name is Loki, to you I am master, or love. I would prefer you call me accordingly."" He stated silently, his thumb caressing her lips. ""You taste as I remembered."" She was in a state of both fear and surprise, she had never seen Loki before, but she didn""t expect him to be this attractive. ""How do you know what I taste like?"" She blushed at the question, but it was only logical. Loki snapped his fingers, seconds later a figure manifested at the end of the bed. She looked just like Ava and wore a long green dress. ""This is Alvida. She is your ancestor."" Loki gestured to the woman and stood, Ava""s eyes traveling down his naked body stopping at his standing erection, he noticed snapping his fingers to get her attention. Her eyes found his beneath hung lashes, he was amused at the red blush over her cheeks. He gestured to the Alvida decoy again. ""I had given her a pinch of my magic a millennium ago. The very magic that you possess."" Ava glared at him. ""Why can""t I use it then?"" He circled the decoy, letting his hand go right through its illusions. ""The chain prevents it."" He stated blankly before stepping back around onto his side of the bed. The decoy disappeared as Loki watched Ava try to take in the events around her. He knew she had never been in such a comfortable place, ever since his rule over Midgard nothing had been the same. The humans were forced to live underground to keep safe from the Chitauri at night. Those that were found above were slaughtered like pigs, so many of her race had died by his action and yet, here he was giving her more mercy and words than he had given to any mortal in a long time. ""I can""t do this... It""s wrong. I barely know you and besides aren""t you supposed to be bad, or something."" He rolled his eyes moving closer to her beneath the covers, but she attempted to move away. The shackle at her ankle making an annoying sound. ""What this is, isn""t love, it""s slavery."" ""Oh yes, I almost forgot, you""ve been pitching yourself around in the library. Found anything interesting on love."" He laid back into his hands in a relaxed manner taking a deep breath and closing his eyes. ""In fact I have. My favorite to be truthful would be that of Hades and-"" She stopped herself, it would encourage the man too much. She looked down at herself, she felt clean and undeniably soft. ""What have you done to me?"" ""You smelled of puke."" He spat, she bit her bottom lip out of embarrassment. ""I ordered my servants to undress you and wash you while I attended to my kingly duties."" ""Hmmm... But you didn""t see me naked.""",6234395
1517,"When Edward was inside, Russel looked at Winry, leaning down a little, ""So,"" he asked, ""How""s my girl?"" ""I""m not your girl, Russel,"" she replied as she put her hands behind her back. She hated this part. Around others, he was a gentleman, but ever since he was fourteen, he""d been flirting and when they were sixteen, he""d promised to go to University and come back to marry her. She""d told him over and over she didn""t feel the same. ""You are...You have been since we were kids,"" he said, leaning in more. ""Russel...stop,"" she said sternly as she backed up against the side of the house. ""Why won""t you accept it?"" he asked softly. He wasn""t menacing, but he was assertive. ""Winry...I""ll be graduating next year...I""ve already been interviewed for jobs...I""ve been working odd jobs already..."" he leaned in closer, reaching his arm out to prop on the house, ""Soon I""ll have the money for a proper ring."" ""Russel, no!"" she said, loud enough to make her point, but not so anyone inside could hear. ""I told you four years ago, and I""m telling you again, I don""t want to marry you."" ""But Winry, I-"" She didn""t let him finish. She ducked under his arm, and went to her door. ""I have guests...come in so you don""t catch cold,"" she said, going in. She figured he""d come in, and he did a minute after she did. In that time, she let her eyes look at the small entrance room, then into the kicthen and the dining table in the middle. Alphonse was talking to Flethcer while they ate, and Noah was serving Edward a bowl of stew. How many servings had he had already, though? Winry figured this might be his second...maybe third. Winry hurried over, then took the ladle from Noah, then said, ""Noah, you don""t have to do that...You""re a guest too. Do you need anymore?"" ""No thank you, I""ve had enough,"" Noah said, taking a seat beside Edward...who was already done with his bowl. ""I""ll have some more, please,"" he said, grinning as he handed her his bowl ""Stew hm? It smells wonderful,"" Russel said, having a seat. Winry grabbed another and fixed him some as well, then she got her own bowl and sat down across from Edward...this left her sitting beside Russel, but as long as he behaved, it would be alright. ""So, what are you studying, Russel?"" Edward suddenly asked. ""A mix of science and engineering...I plant to build and design planes and rockets."" ""You like rockets? Ed knows tons about that,"" Alphonse said. ""Al..."" Edward looked at Alphonse. The younger brother went quiet. ""Do you really?"" Russel asked. Winry guessed the damage had been done. ""Where did you study? Have you built any...? What are your ideas on the aerodynamics-"" ""I""d rather not talk about it,"" Edward said. Winry looked and noticed Noah was moving hr hand. As the woman""s hand tried to cover Edward""s right hand, he shook it off, then he got up, and walked over to Winry. ""I""m sorry, Winry, I think I""m getting tired..."" ""Oh, um...""Winry had just finished her bowl, so she took Edward""s and hers, put them in the tub for the dirty dishes, then she said, ""Alright, just follow me.",512464
58,"Okay, so maybe this wasn""t exactly a traditional diamond-studded wedding ring, but it was clear Brad had put a lot of effort and thought into this gift. When had he ordered this, anyways? Just as he was about to ask, the waiter walked up to their table and Brad and Randy separated, returning towards their forgotten menus. ""We""ll be needing just a few more minutes,"" Randy told the waiter, ""it just all looks so good that I can""t decide."" Brad snorted, and Randy swore he saw the waiter smother a soft chuckle. ""Of course,"" the waiter said, walking off. By the end of dinner, Randy was still under the assumption that however nice this school ring was, it wasn""t an engagement ring. Which begged the question, when was Brad going to purpose? They had about two and a half months before the start of term, and they weren""t married yet. ""You ready to go?"" Brad asked, interrupting Randy""s thoughts. ""Yeah, I am."" Randy took one last drink of his coffee before standing up and slipping his coat on. He watched as Brad placed a ten-dollar bill on the table. When they got to the front, a waiter opened the front door for them; they gave the man a quick nod. A blast of cold air made them shudder, and Brad took Randy""s hand in his as they walked out towards their car. ""Thanks again for the ring,"" Randy said. His free hand gripped the small box tightly in his pocket. ""How long ago did you order this? Had you already decided on going to U.C.? If all this,"" Randy motioned towards the city around him with his head, ""hadn""t happened, when were you going to tell me?"" Randy didn""t have to think twice about if Brad was going to bring Randy with him to college. It was a guarantee, but even if Randy were to be left behind, it""s not like Randy would have actually stayed behind like a good little boy. Married or no, they were stuck with each other for life. They arrived at Brad""s car in silence. Right when Randy was about to ask again, they noticed a small slip of paper had been placed under the windshield wiper on the driver""s side of the car. ""What""s it say?"" Randy asked. ""Let""s find out."" Brad let go of Randy""s hand, and quickly plucked the note from its resting place. Run- M ""Run?"" Randy tilted his head. ""Run from what? And who""s this ""M"" person?"" Brad remained silent, his gaze fixed on the note. Randy placed his hand on his brother""s shoulder. ""Brad?"" ""Change of plans,"" Brad said suddenly, crushing the note in his hand. ""We""re leaving, tonight."" ""What? Where? Why?"" Randy asked fervently. ""What""s going on Brad? What""s-"" Brad silenced him with a kiss. When they pulled apart, Randy had calmed down, but the questions were still burning in his head. Brad immediately dropped to his hands and knees, searching under the car for... something. A minute later, Brad pulled out an envelope which had been duct taped to the base of the car. Brad placed the envelope in Randy""s hands, kissing his lover""s forehead in the process. ""I love you, Randy,"" Brad said. Randy then got shooed to the passenger side of the car. After getting in the car and buckling up, he finally opened the envelope.",583994
3329,"The last part of the pictorial will now begin!"" Sebastian announced. Everyone sat back to his or her seats, waiting in anticipation.What is Maya""s secret weapon...?Oh, you""ll see in a few seconds.The curtains opened as the background changed again. It was now a beach.Could it be that..?Yuta was standing on the stage; all spotlights were focused on him. His current attire is what caught the attention of the audience.Bikini.Yup, Kirishima Yuta is wearing a bikini.The bikini was pink in color, simple but it appealed.Different reactions were again heard from the audience. ""Yuta is in a bikini... waaah! He""s soooo cute!"" Mito squealed. ""Is Yuta really a girl...?"" Nina whispered. ""Could I ask how did he achieve his chest?"" Tsujiai mused.""Tsujiai?!"" Kaji and the prince chorused. They looked at their friend disbelievingly. Tsujiai is so suspicious, very suspicious...""It looks so real..."" Ayu suddenly added. ""Yuta looks nice on that bikini,"" Mikami-sensei said thoughtfully. ""Where did he get the bikini?"" Rio asked.""GAK! I now remember why those dresses are familiar,"" Luna suddenly said. They looked at her curiously. ""What do you mean? """"Those clothes, including that bikini, were Maya""s,"" answered Luna. Everyone""s attention turned to Maya.""Maya""s?!"" Everyone except for Sebastian, Luna and Maya chorused.""So?"" Maya said- her tone was not carrying any emotion at all.""So?! They are yours!"" Mikami-sensei blurted out.""So? """"How can you let Yuta wear them?"" Tsujiai rephrased Mikami-sensei""s comment. ""Why not? I do not wear such clothes, for Pete""s sake!"" Maya answered as she flipped her hair. ""Poor clothes..."" Nina said.""Maya-chan!"" Yuta ran to them. ""This bikini is totally amazing! It""s so cute! I""m telling you, you have a very good sense of fashion! """"Not really, Yuka-chan,"" she tuck a loose strand behind his ear. ""Anyway, we should get this done before the Jusenkyo Potion loses its effect,"" she said as she and Yuta made their way to the stage.Nina giggled while Tsujiai had a thoughtful look on his face. It seems Maya is comfortable with gay-type Yuta. Hmm... The theory of putting the two is possible, very possible. ""I wonder how the TRUE Yuta would react when he learns that there was a part in his life where he has done two things no one could imagine he""ll do: first, cross-dressing, second: being cozy with Orihara,"" Kaji mused while Mito giggled like crazy. ""I would love to see his reaction,"" Rio snickered.----------------------------As the sun continued to set, the lone figure suddenly collapsed in the dry road.""I... I.... can""t give up! I WILL NEVER GIVE UP! I""ll find them no matter what! Especially the man I loved...""--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------To Be Continued...So what do you think? Please review!The person speaking in the last part will be revealed in the upcoming chapters.I may not able to update for a while because of school and my other fanfic in GTO so please be patient with me.

2166,"He lets out a sigh and just headed to the locker room, brushing it off of his mind but he is keep a lookout for Meena and an even closer eye on Trevor too. We""ll see how Trevor becomes later on the story and only Morrison sees right through his cool facade soon. There""s more coming up soon! Picking up from where the last chapter went off...here""s the answer as to will Meena take the bait to get back with Trevor. Chapter 20: Already Turning Him Down Meena was still trying to get herself back on track after going through the most painful revelation she has endured...watching her crush kiss another girl that Friday night. She couldn""t get over that experience of what it was like watching her dreams and hopes of one day being his girlfriend would burst into flames, even though he had degraded her in front of everyone. She tried to put it all behind her and just move on with her life and forget about Trevor because there""s no way that she""ll come back to that again. When she went to her locker, she saw a note on there and when she picked it up and opened, he saw that it was from Morrison. He writes... Hey, Meena I know that you""ve had a rough weekend because of what""s his name kissing in front of you Friday night. I just wanted to let you know that if you need someone to talk to, we can always talk on our window, text or maybe FaceTime each other. And thanks for giving me the belief to go into music. I mean, you have always pushed me to pursue music and since the game, I""m thinking about spending time at the Moon Theater, so we can hang out more. You""re an awesome person and you""ll find someone better than Trevor one day. Sorry if I didn""t get a chance to call you this weekend. Hope you""re feeling better! Morrison P.S. : Thanks for the cake! It was so good! That letter made Meena feel a lot better knowing that it came from Morrison and it definitely shows how much he cares about her and it meant a lot. She stashed it in her pocket so that whenever she feels down, she""ll look at the letter and carry it with her. She got her books, closed the locker and when she turned around, there""s Trevor. Meena sighed deeply as she faced him and she said, ""What do you want?"" Trevor looks as if he""s reverting to his cool self with a humble approach and he said, ""Listen, I""d like to apologize for kissing that girl right in front of you. I was wrong, it was stupid and I should never had hurt you."" ""You really did hurt me, Trevor."" Meena added. ""Yeah, I know. She meant nothing to me. I""ve been so stupid and jealous that you would lose me. I promise you that I""ll never degrade you or humiliate you again. It""ll be like it never happened."" Trevor said, trying to be as humble as possible. Meena blinked her eyes at this and part of her wanted to believe him, but another part of her kinda held her back because he might be up to his old tricks again and lapse back into being a jerk again and she said, ""But it did happen. I saw you kiss that girl right in front of me."" ""And I don""t blame you for being upset.",1276465
2909,"She was always very nice to me, but I felt that her interests lay with someone else. I didn""t know it was Gabe until Gabe came one night into my room and told me that there had been something going on between him and Natalya. We talked about it for a while, and then I asked him what Gabe intended to do about Jordan. After all, Jordan was his girlfriend, and had been for seven years. Gabe didn""t know what to do. He said he loved Jordan, but he needed a change."" Jamie smirked. ""Of course I said I could understand him. I was a young man, and so was Gabe, but we were both grown up and could do what we wanted. I felt a little sorry for Jordan, because I knew that Gabe was her everything, but Gabe assured me that he wouldn""t leave her. So I figured he might just as well make a few experiences. I decided to stay out of the whole story. ""But that didn""t work. The others noticed of course that Natalya had a thing going with one of us, and Gabriel got scared. Don""t forget that these were the sixties, Detectives. We were out in the middle of nowhere, untouched by the hippies and the message of free love. Our parents were still rather old-fashioned in their points of view. And Gabriel had always been the quiet one of us both. Gabriel was now fearing that our parents would flip out if they learned that he, of all things, was having an affair with the housemaid rather than staying with his long-term girlfriend whom everyone thought he would marry one day. So he asked me for advice, and the only thing I could think of was to pretend that it was me, not Gabe, who had this affair. I was known as the wild son, anyway; no one would be surprised to hear that. It was of course unfair for Natalya, but Gabe and I explained the situation to her. I guess she knew from the start that the thing with Gabe wouldn""t last. And after all, it was not that she loved him deeply. Natalya was a strange person, you know. She seemed to be so shy, but in fact she was a straightforward person. She knew exactly what she and Gabe did, she knew about Jordan, and she knew that, if forced, Gabe would always choose Jordan. But she was looking for a little fun, too. ""Anyway, we talked to Natalya, and she agreed to deny any connection to Gabriel but support rumors about her and me. It was very amusing, actually. She and I""d pretend to whisper conspiratorially, we""d set dates, and she""d watch me when I was passing by - in a way everyone would notice, of course. And all the time it was actually her and Gabe. She came to think of me as a sort of accomplice, I think. We almost became friends. ""That worked for a little while. The rumors spread, and Natalya and I did our parts not to let them cease. Everyone believed the stories. ""But after a while, Gabe was getting tired of Natalya. He""d had enough fun, he figured, and it was time for him to return to Jordan. He tried to tell Natalya, but somehow he never managed. If only he had! I don""t think Natalya would""ve made any problems. She didn""t love Gabriel. But she didn""t know about his feeling, so of course the thing went on and on.",240213
3782,"Abruptly, Aurora ended the attack and the sobbing woman ran away like a frightened child. Iracebeth was oddly quiet that night. The servants in the castles whispered, the courtiers whispered, and she knew it was all about her and that none of it was good. Her depression made her blue-shadowed eyes seem even heavier. ""All the rioters have been arrested, Your Majesty, and everyone else has been ordered to go back to their homes. You have nothing to fear,"" Stayne told her. He was startled when she looked up at him-crystalline tears were running down her cheeks. ""But I do, Ilosovic..."" she choked, ""it is only a matter of time before they find a away if they despise me enough...my tiny-headed sister has the Vorpal Sword and Alice and I fear that our time is running out!"" Ordinarily, Stayne would have gone to her, comforted her, but Aurora""s presence made it seem wrong. Though he was certain she""d forgive him, he refrained. ""The only two people I can trust in the world are here in this room,"" Iracebeth lamented, ""you and my mute artist with her mutant wings! Everyone else is just waiting to get me!"" The look that passed between Stayne and Aurora went totally unnoticed. It was ironic that the two people that were the most dangerous were right here in this room. All the servants and courtiers had been ordered out earlier. It would be fairly easy... No. Aurora shook her head. Stayne nearly jumped out of his skin. He had been so deep in thought that he had allowed his thoughts to be exposed to her. It unnerved him. There is too much blood on your hands as it is. Leave her be, Ilosovic. Her voice was, once again, in that thick accent she used when she was upset. But she wasn""t angry with him...he would have felt it. She seemed sad, regretful almost. She didn""t want Stayne to suffer more than he had. Life is like that sometimes, she thought at Iracebeth, there is a season for everything. A season to be sick, to be healthy...a season to labor and a season to rest...a season to rule and a season to serve...maybe if you stopped trying to make things go the way you want and just let time take its course, you would be happier. ""Who said that?"" Iracebeth demanded. I did. Stayne did not suppress his look of surprise. He could hear her voice in his head just as clearly as if she""d been speaking out loud. Iracebeth stared at her. ""You can talk?"" I think the word for it is ""thought-transference"". She stomped over to Aurora and stared at her hard as if trying to figure out a puzzle. ""It worked...it actually worked! You can control them with your mind! And you can speak! Perhaps all isn""t lost after all!"" She whisked out of the room yelling for something. Don""t look at me like that, Aurora scolded Stayne. ""Do you realize what you""ve just done?"" he asked her, ""Now she""ll never want to let you go. You""ll be nothing but a tool to her!"" She can""t make me do anything, Aurora told him, she only believes that she can. There""s no threat on earth great enough to make me fear her.",870118
1800,"""I don""t know,"" Iceland was bewildered. He took me by my good arm, and his face turned worried saw my shoulder. I looked over and saw a bit of red on the bandages; I must have torn the stitches when I hit the wall, ""Seychelles, you shoulder-"" ""Iceland!"" His face snapped up to England, ""They came out of nowhere. The troops are mobilizing-"" ""Air or ground forces?"" ""Air,"" The two started down the hall again. Soldiers made way, and Iceland pulled me along much gentler than England had, ""A direct attack for the main base."" ""What is France thinking?"" England seethed, ""A direct attack... it""s suicide. Our anti-air artillery-"" ""They took one or two down before the planes reached us,"" Iceland said, ""But I got a report from the front; they""ve started a full on assault there."" ""Dammit, France..."" England threw open the door to the conference room. A few other nations were in there, but I couldn""t see Italy anywhere. ""This isn""t a well thought out attack,"" Norway said from the back of the room. ""Who""s manning the front right now?"" England demanded. ""Denmark, Scotland, and Switzerland,"" He said, ""I was going to head there now."" ""This isn""t right,"" Austria paced at the head of the room, ""It""s a wild attack, like a beasts. It""s not how France fights. He""s methodical, tests our defenses to find a weakness. He""s smarter than this."" ""He""s lost it,"" Ireland murmured, ""Gone completely off the deep end."" Gone off the deep end. Insane. Nation-killer. I shuddered, unconsciously gripping Iceland""s hand tighter. He tilted his head back to me a bit. England saw that, and my terrified, tear-stained face. ""We have to get Seychelles and Germany out,"" My head shot up. Get us out? Now? In the middle of an airstrike?"" ""We can""t,"" Norway shook his head, mirroring my thoughts, ""Until the skies clear, we can""t get a plane out safely."" ""Ship then; get them to Malmo, then Trondheim,"" England argued. ""Who""s going to man it?"" Norway said, his voice level, ""We can""t spare the men, England."" England growled. Ireland looked passed him and locked eyes with me, ""He""s after her ""body"". Give her up."" ""No!"" Both England and Iceland shouted. I was startled, and tensed. Norway raised an eyebrow at Iceland, who looked away. ""Iceland, prepare a cargo plane to transport Seychelles and Germany along with the critically injured,"" England said, adding before anyone could protest, ""As soon as the skies are cleared, get her out of here."" ""I""m not leaving,"" Iceland shook his head. ""Do it, Iceland,"" Norway said. The other nation""s head snapped over to him in shock, ""We need someone to go and get as many of the refugee nations to join us here or on the Russian front as possible."" ""But Norway-"" He protested. Norway sighed, ""Just go."" ""Tch,"" Iceland hesitated for a moment. That gave me an opening. My eyes locked on England, ""I""m not going anywhere, Arthur!"" If I couldn""t help France, and if he really had killed those nations like England said, then the least I could do was help stop him. I don""t know how I could help, but there had to be something. I wasn""t a useless colony anymore; I could fight too.",748687
1185,"Hotchner and Rossi were there, pouring over papers from the plethora of evidence and reports from both the Christenson case and the one the media had dubbed the ""BabyKiller"". Someone had leaked to the press about the case and it""s international connection; reporters were everywhere now. Clamoring to get even the slimmest bit of information regarding a case this big. I couldn""t help but feel sorry for J.J.; she would be busy with this one. A nationwide press conference... I shuddered at the mere thought of speaking publicly in front of that many people. ""Found anything?"" She asked Hotch and Rossi, the former just shaking his head while the latter looked up at her rather lazily, ""Not yet. We""re waiting on word from Morgan and Emily."" ""Well, it seems that the unsub only let""s out his aggression postmortem rather then when the victim is alive,"" I said quietly, sitting down next to Rossi, ""The victim dies from a lethal dose of the Barbituate derivative Methohexital, suggesting that the unsub either has access to it or is getting the drug off the black market."" ""There""s the good doctor,"" Rossi said quietly. Hotchner nodded; he flipped out his phone and dialed quickly, ""Garcia? I need you to look up St. Mary""s records. Anything that has to do with Methohexital, specifically who it""s been prescribed to, what doctors have prescribed it, if any stock has gone missing, et cetera. Go back the last thirteen years, if you can..."" She must have said something to him, but Hotch looked over at me quickly, ""Yes, he is, why?"" A sigh escaped him and Hotch shook his head, ""Alright, but make it short, okay? I am expecting Morgan or Emily to call soon."" My eyebrows shot up as he handed the phone across the table to me. Looking at him incredulously, I saw him mouth ""She wants to talk to you"" and sighed. I picked up the phone and said a rather apprehensive ""Hello?"" Then it began, ""Reid, I am so sorry! I saw you go storming out of the room, then heard this bang and... and... oh, I am so sorry! I called Derek and all he told me was J.J. was taking you to the hospital! Are you okay? Please, please tell me you""re okay. I would feel so bad if you broke yourself or the precinct because of what I said! Oooh it was so stupid of me to tell you! I should have... I dunno, done something different! Spence, honey, I am so-"" ""It""s okay, I""m alright Garcia,"" I sighed again, shaking my head with the ghost of a grin present on my face. Penelope Garcia, the ""Mother Hen"" of the BAU, ""Just hit a wall."" My attempt to calm her was a waste after my last few words, ""Hit a wall?! Oh my god, Reid, is your hand okay? I didn""t know you would react so strongly... you""re usually so cool and awkward... I am so sorry! Is anything broken, honey? Please, please tell me you""re-"" ""I thought I already said I was okay, Garcia,"" I sighed, ""There""s no break; Hotch just wanted to make sure, so he had J.J. drive me to the hospital."" Before Garcia could sling another plethora of apologies, I handed the phone back to Hotchner and gave another sigh. Rossi, on the other hand, looked amused.",748687
1322,"""Don""t worry Reed I""ll buy a new one,"" Johnny said as he turned his head toward Dawn. He quickly got up and walked toward her. ""Glad you came, I guess you""ve already met Reed, you""ll meet the rest later,"" Johnny said as fast as he could. ""Calm down Johnny I""m not going tune you out but I will if I have to,"" Dawn said. About that time the Thing or as some people would call him Ben walked out. ""Oh Dawn that huge load over there is Ben,"" Dawn laughed as Ben yelled, ""Your going to regret that later flame boy."" Ben walked over and looked Dawn over and said to Johnny, "" You better not do anything to this one Johnny, she might kill you if you try."" Ben then looked back to Dawn and said, ""Hi my name is Ben I""m a friend on Johnny""s. His sister is in the kitchen cooking."" Dawn nodded at what he said and then the other""s led her to the kitchen where she saw a blond girl and well shaped as well working at the stove. The woman turned around and smiled at Dawn. ""Hi you must be that girl that Johnny talks about all the time,"" Dawn blushed at that. She couldn""t believe he told everyone about her. ""I guess so, my names Dawn,"" Dawn said. ""My name is Sue I""m Johnny""s sister. If you have any trouble you can call me and I""ll fix it,"" Sue said walking over and shaking her hand. ""Wait a minute your that one girl who tore up my car two weeks ago,"" Dawn said. ""Like I said I""ll fix anything. I think Reed knows how to fix that car back to its place,"" Sue said flashing Reed a look of concern. ""Yeah I""ll see that you get another car that looks and is built just like it,"" Reed said. ""Good,"" Dawn said smirking. ""Alright is everyone ready to eat,"" Sue said starting to place all the food on the table. Everyone said yeah. ""You know it""s nice to have another girl here, at least now we can control these guys,"" Sue said walking over to the table to sit down. Johnny being the charmer he was pulled the seat out for Dawn. Dawn blushed and said, ""Thank you Johnny."" ""Your welcome,"" Johnny said flashing one of his charming smiles as he sat down. ""So what""s for dinner sis,"" Johnny said. ""Lasagna, garlic bread, and salad,"" Sue said smiling. ""No I mean for desert,"" Johnny said smirking. Sue shot him a glare but answered with, ""Heard of a mini angel pie."" ""Oh I have they""re very good, my mother can fix the best chocolate one,"" Dawn said smiling at her. Sue smiled back and then both of them shot the others a gaze meaning what about you. ""Never heard of it,"" the boys said in unison. Sue sat down after all the food was placed. They said a prayer and began to eat while talking about various things like, cars, woman problems, men problems, Reed""s new invention, and last but not least how Dawn should be Johnny""s new girl friend which he agreed to quickly but Dawn just gave that look that meant no and then said it. After dinner Reed showed her his new invention, which was some kind of chip that you insert into someone""s skin and a remote that is on a watch that changes your appearance. He was still working on it but he thought it was coming along nicely.",806976
3074,"I""ll grow old like you, and never regenerate."" He took a breath and looked at Rose. ""I""ve only got one life now - and I could spend it with you, if you want."" Rose fell silent. Then she lifted up her hand and placed it on his chest, feeling the beating of his heart soft under her palm. Just one heart, just like he""d said. The Doctor and Donna started to turn around, and Rose quickly turned. ""But it""s still not right!"" she protested. ""Rose, he is me,"" the Doctor reiterated, briefly touching her hand. ""He""s got my mind... he remembers everything we did together, everything that happened after you left... he""s got my quirks and my mannerisms - well, and he might have inherited one or two from Donna, sorry about that! - but what""s most important, he has a human heart. He has feelings I could never have. He can give you things I could never give you."" He was looking at her, a serious look in his eyes. ""And he needs you as I needed you when I first met you,"" he added. ""You can start anew, together, and it will make almost no difference for you."" ""But what about you?"" Rose raised a hand to touch his cheek. ""Ah, I""ll be fine!"" He seemed to want to shrug off the matter, but Rose continued to stroke his cheek. ""You""ll never see me again, and that""s definite this time,"" she said. ""Donna told me that you were mourning me even two years after we were separated. I don""t want you to be sad again."" A soft smile curled his lips, and he reached up to cover her hand on his cheek with his. ""But don""t you see the beauty of this, Rose? I""m giving you the part of me that""s been missing you the most, needing you the most. And since he is a part of me, everything you give him will somehow reach me, too, and it will be enough."" Rose bit her lower lip, looking back at the other Doctor. ""Come here, you two,"" she said eventually. ""I have a question for both of you."" Standing between the two, she looked from one to the other. ""When I was last standing on this beach on the most horrible day of my life, what was the last thing you said to me?"" she asked. The Doctor swallowed. ""I said ""Rose Tyler"","" he answered. ""So how was that sentence going to end?"" Rose demanded to know, her eyes fixed on the Doctor. He slightly shook his head. ""Does it need saying?"" he asked softly. So he still wasn""t able to say it. Rose swallowed and turned to the other. ""Doctor?"" Her voice was trembling. The other Doctor laid a hand on her arm and bowed to her. His lips were almost touching her ear as he whispered his response: ""I was going to say it back."" Rose stared at him for a second, processing what he""d said. Say it back - say what back? What had she said directly before? I love you. It all fell into place. The other Doctor, with the human heart. Able to express feelings, able to feel love, and love her back. With sudden determination, Rose grabbed front of his jacket, pulled him close, and kissed him. After a moment, he responded, cautiously but with utter tenderness, and Rose wrapped her arms firmly around his neck, drew a shuddering breath and allowed the kiss to deepen.",240213
1778,"His heart sunk, but she laughed at his expression and stopped to pound a playful fist at his royal garment. ""I""m just joking you silly goof."" ""I wish I could see you more. I really do."" He mumbled, but received no response. The two had closed in on her father""s workshop. He had made a living selling and buying swords, or other fancy things of metal. The wooden door was wide open and the hand painted sign hung clearly above it. She pulled him into the workshop where a series of shelves resided each cluttered with authentic items, scrap metal, or gold and silver trinkets. He father was at the desk speaking with a customer about some sort of dwarven necklace. She sneaked around her father to the door behind him leading upstairs to the actual home portion of the shop. Boromir nearly tripped as she yanked him harder up the stairs. ""For the love of... Kierra I am not going anywhere right now."" At the top of the stairs she looked to him, the grip on her hand loosening a bit and Boromir wished he could take back those words. He liked having her hold onto him for dear life. ""I know... I""m just-"" ""So excited, as I have been told me. Show me this gift already, would you?"" He caressed her knuckles slightly, in which she turned again and guided him to her room. Which he had never been in before, it wasn""t small and it wasn""t big. Everything was neat, the vanity was across from the bed as was the wardrobe and most of the room was filled with vibrant colors of blue and purple, some greens to contrast. She released his hand and walked over to the end table beside her bed, while he stood quietly and looked around. ""I wanted to give you something. A good luck charm of sorts because I know you being as clumsy as you are. You""ll need it."" Boromir cackled. ""It was an accident."" ""You dumping a bucket of water on my head was no accident, Prince of Gondor."" She strode back over to him again, her slippers clicking against the wood and she held it up to him. It was a cloth, his expression softened from a smile to an unknown feeling of adoration. Her initials were threaded into it so neatly with a heart surrounding it in black. He looked back up at her, his hands reaching out to grab the cloth. A small smile hinted on her pillow like lips along with a red blush that accented her beauty so well. ""You are leaving tomorrow, so I wanted to give you something to remember me by."" His eyebrows furrowed. ""How did you-"" ""My uncle is a soldier as is my late cousin. They are coming over for dinner tonight because they are leaving for battle tomorrow near the ruins of the old city."" Boromir remained silent, fiddling with the cloth between his thumb and index. Her hands gently cupping under his. ""I want to give you something else. This way you know what you""ll be coming back to."" He couldn""t reply before she had leaned up and gently pressed her lips to his. It was the sweetest kiss he had ever felt and for her, it was her first. She reveled in it, he wanted more of it. Then she pulled away, blushing deeply up at him in which he snorted nervously.",6234395
705,"But as I felt the tap and looked down, all air wooshed from me. A long, thin blade rested gently on my hip. ""I had a list, once,"" she said, as calm and collected like one would discuss the weather, ""Every single person on that list is dead. I even fed one of them his own children."" I was sweating, eyes wide. In a single flick of the wrist, she could disembowel me, ""I did it all for myself and my family. And I would do it a thousand times over. Would you?"" I blinked, breath shallow and mouth dry. Her blade dug in tighter and stung at my hip, ""I-I""ve never killed nobody."" ""Would you?"" Arya leaned forward slightly. There was something dangerous in her eyes, a wild glint of an animal kept caged too long, ""Would you hunt me down, if I took someone you loved? Would you do anything to protect them, avenge them?"" ""If you...?"" My eyes widened. I""d never considered killing anyone. But this girl, younger than I, had the exact eyes I""d imagined a killer would have. When I didn""t answer, she tapped my hip with the sword. I swallowed thickly, knowing from her probing eyes that lying wasn""t an option, ""I would want... To protect them. I-I would stop you from killing th-"" ""That""s not what I asked,"" Arya said, ""If I killed, say, Tyrion Lannister."" Her eyes flashed and I froze. She smiled a bit, a weird quirk of the lips that creased her grim face, ""Would you kill me back?"" ""Yes,"" she leaned back a bit, and the blade was gone. But then her gaze shot back to me when I added, ""Unless you had a really, really good reason."" ""Oh? And what kind of reason would that be?"" ""Are you going to hurt my father, Arya?"" It was easier to be bold when a blade wasn""t pressed against oneself. ""There""s no one on my list at the moment, so no,"" she looked back out the window for a moment, eyes searching. Arya shot me a look when I didn""t say anything. I gulped, ""I-If he""d done something. L-like, killed your family or-or something like that, then... wouldn""t it be justice?"" ""So you""d want to protect those you love, but if they were rotten, twisted things on the inside, you wouldn""t be against disposing of them?"" ""That""s a... callous way of putting it."" She shrugged, ""It""s a better worldview than one where those in power rule like tyrants because the people who cared more about themselves and said tyrants did nothing."" ""But your brother""s the one in power,"" I flinched when her eyes snapped to mine, ""Even though he doesn""t want to be."" ""So you""d support Jon? Not everyone""s happy he has the throne. And besides, him not wanting it is the best reason for him to have it."" I shot up, immediately gripping at the roof of the carriage so I didn""t tumble on my still tender leg, ""Of course I would!"" She regarded me for a long time in silence. I wanted to bolt from the carriage, but it was still in motion. That would not be a good plan if I wanted to stay in trampled. Then Arya looked away, face impassive yet oddly satisfied. This time, it was I who purposefully sat as far from her in the carriage as possible. I slipstitched the hole in my dress closed before anyone else went into the cabin.",748687
2984,"Wolfram didn""t"" respond, but she knew from his expression that his legs had been bothering him for some time. Because she was often busy, she didn""t get many chances to just sit and talk with him like this. Without hesitation Greta started tinkering with Wolfram""s bio-mechanical knees and shins. ""Eww... father, that""s gross! The skin clamps for your legs are infected again... really..."" ""They will pay, Greta. They will all pay... for doing this to me. We""ve already gone past the point of redemption. Yuuri would be... so sad now, about us."" Wolfram""s voice was solemn, but they both knew it was the truth. These times reminded Wolfram of his handicap more than ever, leaving the two in silence. This was the price he had paid for destroying the world that Yuuri worked so hard to build. One or two wars, countless fighting and sinning, though all this he had forgotten the exact time the incident happened. Wolfram violently shook off the thoughts and returned his attention back to Greta. Despite all her complaints, Greta couldn""t help but smile. The only time she released her guard, when they both did. In this short time between the early and late morning times, for just a little while, they pretended. They pretended that their reality wasn""t about the war, territory expansion, killing and betrayals. The world was what they imagined it to be, something they desperately wanted to cling on to; reminiscent of the past. Maybe, just maybe if they pretended hard enough, Yuuri might even be able to walk through the door to greet them like he always had. The atmosphere was thick with lies and fake, giddy emotions. Obeying the crown was a sinister crimeHis soul was tortured by loss and by pain - the oath made him stay It happened on that day, what now seems like such a long, long time ago. The day Wolfram""s entire world broke down into minuscule, irrecoverable pieces. That day, right after that fateful battle which made even the fates hold their breath. Near that burnt down mansion, in the field which felt like nothing more than an open grave... He""s torn between his honor and the true love of his lifeHe prayed for both but was denied Wolfram""s voice screamed in agony, the words inaudible and unimportant. The dead grass hurt his body as he pulled himself along the ground towards Elizabeth""s body. Deep in his heart, he already knew the truth behind what had happened. Yuuri and Murata were gone when he woke up. The warm hand that he fell asleep with left a horrible feeling behind on the wind. His kimono was torn and barely covering him, his chest full of grass stains and superficial cuts from the dead grass blades. Behind all of Yuuri""s nice words, and the motivation behind his actions, everything had been nothing more than a lie. ""You... lied to me, Yuuri! YOU FUCKING BASTARD!"" Tears ran a line down his dust and slightly ashy face. His eyes focused on nothing but Elizabeth, but his mind found nothing but Yuuri. ""You said... you would die with me. But I""m still alive, aren""t I? This world is... too much to bear alone... Yuuri... I love you.",583994
1044,"I""m not entirely sure I trust him, but something tells me that he""s probably not a bad person. Reks, however, found the new guy to be a threat towards him and Vaan""s relationship, founding an immediate disliking and a chance for a constant state of argument with him. It""s never my place to meddle with the internal affairs of others, be it straight or otherwise, it always ends up being a hassle to deal with. Yet, I don""t feel any way around this one other than ignorance as long as humanly possible. If Reks wants to fight Rasler for Vaan and vise versa, it""s not my place to interfere; though I dare say that Fran has taken quite a liking to the newcomer. I sometimes find her watching them intently from amidst the shadows, whatever her intentions are; somehow I seem a bit weary of what they could be. So much for the good old days of when sky pirating meant two people on a treasure hunt, adventure, romance, luxury! It doesn""t quite seem the same anymore, and I can""t quite recall the last time we found any good treasure on a hunt (that I didn""t have to split). Hopefully our little trip to the Lhusu Mines will at least prove entertaining, since I don""t hold that much hope for any sort of treasure or reward. Of course Larsa""s escape from the city of Rabanastre had been a success; in planning ahead, one can do many things that might not seem possible, particularly if the Empire""s guards a placed in every corner of the city. The great sky city of Bhujerba, as it sounds, the city was actually located in the sky. Larsa looked over the side of the bridge leading from the airship port to the city. The sights were absolutely marvelous, and he made a mental note to come back here if, indeed, he ever had time to relax and ""sight see"". Entering the mines was going to be dangerous, no two ways about it. By himself, he had known he probably wouldn""t be able to make it that far alone; yet standing just outside the building housing the lounge for those whom had come from the airships seemed to be the perfect place to start. Under the pretense of exploring the sights, he could quietly scout for a party which looked strong enough to take on the mines and possibly live long enough to still make it out alive. Most of the citizens here were either on vacation or some sort of personal reasons; the few here on business were the ones to look out for. Sometimes, hiding in plain sight was the best way to get the answers needed to continue on. Somewhat unexpectedly, Larsa found the party he had been looking for quite readily. He first heard the name of the Lhusu mines, the group having stopped near his location to talk about it. They mentioned something about monsters and rewards, more then likely being on some sort of hunt. Well, that means they probably wouldn""t mind a little extra help, if he didn""t ask for any of the physical rewards in the end. ""Are you headed to the Lhusu Mines, then?"" The men were tall, having an atmosphere of a mix of shady, ruggedly strong and greedy. Typical sky pirates, Larsa thought in the back of his mind.",583994
1825,"You""re really lucky, Tsukimori-kun, to be able to experience all of these from such a young age. Ah! Truly lucky!"" Tsukimori watched as Kahoko gazed at a distance. He really did not understand women. They are impulsive, unpredictable, and temperamental. But did they have this side to them as well? Contemplative? When Kahoko tilted her head and fixed her golden orbs on him, he felt as if she was seeing past him. ""Maybe-maybe someday I can enter your world, Tsukimori-kun. Little by little,"" she flashed a bright smile. Pivoting gracefully, she continued walking and she resumed humming. Had she really matured as a musician this much? Somehow, a warm feeling seeped into his heart, a feeling similar to the pride felt by a mentor as he watch his apprentice achieve greater things. ""I-I""ll be waiting for you,"" he said quietly but loud enough for Kahoko to hear. ""So.. don""t get too cocky. You still have a lot of learning to do,"" he paused before smiling-it was a small smile but was gentle. ""Hino Kahoko."" Seeping from her chest was a warm feeling that coursed through her veins, propagating throughout her whole being. He was finally treating her as an equal, worthy of being allowed to his world. She couldn""t help but feel the bubbling joy inside of her as she nodded, accepting his challenge. And Tsukimori Len felt content. The girl he had witnessed struggling with music was finally facing it head-on. The strength of her determination really astounded him. Her character, her passion in doing the thing she loves -they prompt him to strive harder. Everything about her always stirred something in him-was it his long forgotten passion to enjoy music? Whatever it was, he would always be watching her. To be Continued... The title of the song Hamai Misa mentioned is No Other Love. It is a lovely song, try listening to it some time. Yes, this story is romance but I just had to insert Tsukimori""s and Hino""s respect for each other as musicians. Especially for Tsukimori, I think before he develops that romantic love for Hino, he would first have that deep respect for her as a musician. What do you think? Please Review! Hi guys! Thank you for all those who read and reviewed last chapter! Here""s chapter 6 of In Return. NOTE: In the first chapter, it said that it was six days before the concert. I am changing the date of the concert, making it nine days. That means, the concert is now on a Saturday instead of the original Thursday. Chapter 6 Monday, Pocky Magic and Tuesday Monday Scratching her head using the eraser end of a pencil, Kahoko sighed heavily. It was impossible to finish this math assignment in thirty minutes especially that her mind had shut down everything but those related to music. She could hear it now- Bach""s symphony echoing in the background as she tells her sensei that she completely forgot about the assignment because she was too absorbed practicing with her violin all weekend. The derivative of 3x squared is- ""Ah! Mou!"" she cried as she allowed her head to rest against her knees. Why did she remember the assignment only ten minutes ago?",560480
2936,"""I""m sure he is. He""s kinda surrounded with trees with thick leaves. We""re just a bit unlucky."" James sat on the ground and leaned on the wall, letting it support all of his weight. Sofia sat beside him, feeling a bit cold. As he noticed that the brunette beside him was shivering slightly, he placed an arm around her and pulled her close against him. Sofia peered at him and gave him a smile to show her gratitude. James returned the smile and placed a small kiss on her forehead. ""I hope that warmed you up."" He said. Blood rushed to her cheeks, successfully warming her face up. ""Yes, it helped a bit."" She replied, not taking her eyes off of her prince. They stared at each other""s eyes for a moment, until they leaned towards the other and closed the gap between them. As their kiss went deeper, James placed his arm from her shoulders to her torso, gently laying her down the ground. Not creating a gap between their lips, he hovered on top of Sofia and placed his hands beside her to support his weight. They pulled away after a moment, staring deeply in to each other""s eyes and panting heavily. ""Are you warm enough?"" James asked as he caressed the cheek of the brunette princess beneath him. ""Not yet."" Sofia muttered her reply as she placed her arms around James"" neck to pull him down for another kiss. The heavy rain toned down to a gentle drizzle, but the two were still inside their own world, not letting go of each other. Oooooooooooooooh what are they doiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing? ;)) I""ll let your imagination do it hihihihi Hopefully, an idea would roll in for chapter 4. Thanks for bearing with me! See ya! HEY GUYS OMG I""M BACK! And I am so sorry for the unannounced hiatus ;A; I literally stopped writing once more in a middle of a chapter and left it hanging. I had to watch the stupid skating rink episode with Hugo in it so that I could write the rest of the chapter. Hugo was the key. (wut) Anyway! Hope you enjoy this chapter~ Amber knocked at her twin""s door. It was early in the morning, and James had promised that he would agree to come for his outfit""s sizing. Though the tailor is visiting in the afternoon, she was a bit worried that James and Sofia haven""t returned yet. Amber knew that James was going to go out with Sofia for the night. She also promised to not tell a single soul in the castle. After a few more seconds of waiting, she sighed and halted her knocking. ""Are they even home yet?"" she asked herself. As she was about to turn her heel and leave, the door opened, revealing James inside. ""Amber?"" he called out, his hair a bit messy and his clothes wrinkled. Amber""s eyes widened upon seeing the blond prince""s look, wondering where the two went to. ""Why do you look so... bedraggled?"" she asked. James"" cheeks turned into a slight shade of crimson as he leaned on the doorway with a hand on his mouth. Amber waited for her twin brother to speak up, as James composed himself in front of her. ""We got caught by the rain last night. So we sheltered in a cave for the whole night."" He said.",2750536

Just then, mounds of police and paramedics came in and they""ve witnessed the entire melee at the school and as the war continued on, Jesse was gonna shoot Lars anyway and he bellowed, ""DIE, MEXICAN!"" Before he could even kill him, he got struck by a taser gun and as he fell down to the ground, a few police offers came in and ended this scene by pulling out fire hoses at the students that caused a freakin"" ruckus.

Chapter 15: Huge Wake-Up Call Brent slowly opened his eyes and lets out a few groans in pain and as soon as he woke up, he found himself in a much different place and he slowy sat up and he looks around and sees that he""s in the emergency room at the hospital and he lets out a few breaths and asked, ""How did I get here?"" Brent felt a little sharp pain on his shoulder and winces a little bit and when he looked at his shoulder, he could see his bullet hole there and he almost remembered everything that had happened back at the school when Jesse wanted to shoot Lars, but Brent pushed him out and the bullet struck onto Brent""s arm. He let out a sharp exhale and wondered how he survived through that and he asked, ""Am I dead?"" ""No, but you could""ve been."" Brent turns around and he sees a nurse standing there and he looked over at Brent and he said, ""You are a very lucky young man. The bullet would""ve took you out in an instant."" ""How do you mean?"" asked Brent. ""When the police saw you got shot, they thought you might""ve gotten killed and the bullet nearly pierced your fatal spot on your left shoulder, but the doctors were able to get it out of you, luckily."" Brent lets out a deep exhale and he could actually visualize that on his head and how what would""ve happened if he hadn""t have survived. But it was a miracle that he""s still alive because he risked his life for Lars and th nurse looks at him and responds, ""Quick thinking on your part, young man. It takes someone with a lot of courage to do something like that to a friend."" ""Aw, it was nothing. I just figured that I would get shot rather than Lars."" Brent said.",1276465
2748,"I hope you find the person you""re looking for."" Zidane stood up while giving Garnet one of his mischievous grins. ""It will be my pleasure, your majesty."" Then in one swift motion Zidane turned and headed towards the door, leaving Garnet standing on the balcony. Zidane stretched as he walked down the sunlit hallways of the castle. Judging from the angle the sun shone though the windows, Zidane guessed it was already early noon. Even though Zidane had been a guest in this castle for the past two years, it always amazed him just how beautiful the many corridors of the castle could be under the gentle touch of the sun""s rays. As Zidane continued his path down the long corridor, he could hear the sound of light footsteps running towards him from behind. ""Zidane! Zidane, I finally found you!"" A soft voice could be heard lightly echoing off of the light stone walls. Zidane trued around, watching as Eiko slowed from a run to a walk. ""I""ve been searching everywhere for you, you know."" Zidane smiled at her. ""You know, that""s funny, because I""ve been doing the exact same thing."" Zidane watched as Eiko smiled back at him, before her hands covered her face as she started laughing. The first thing people saw when they looked at Eiko would be her short blue hair and small unicorn horn that protruded from her forehead. Her soft blue hair bounced with her before resting once again just below her shoulders. Eiko""s soft yellow gown, adorned with the light imprints of small flowers gracefully outlined her small frame. ""Garnet said you might be looking for me, but she also said the strangest thing: ""Don""t stand too close to Zidane unless he asks you to."" I""m not sure what she meant by that but... Okay."" Eiko looked at Zidane, a look of curiosity showing upon her face. Eiko seemed almost cat-like with her emotions. Darkness... Longing... Pain... Chains of Steel bound to soft, thin wrists... ""Zidane?"" Suddenly Zidane clasped his head, screaming out from the sudden pain. ""I see darkness... steel chains... pain... Who are you? What do you want with me?"" Isolation... Strength... Weakness... The soft touch of flesh against cold, hard stone floors... ""Zidane..."" Eiko stepped forward before catching herself. ""That""s right, Sister Garnet told me not to get to close, but... why?"" Eiko watched apprehensively as Zidane fell to his knees, the pain seeming to become more unbearable as the time went by. The look in Eiko""s eyes seemed as pain-filled as what Zidane was experiencing. It hurt her that she had to just stand by and watch as her friend was slowly being taken over by an unknown source. ""Wait... this pain... could it be... from... an unknown source?"" A familiar voice, ""Please help me... the darkness..."" Zidane cried out once again. ""Who are you? Please, tell me who you are. I... want to help you..."" Blood dripped down a soft, pale cheek... the incessant cold laughter of a light, male voice... ""It""s pathetic. You are nothing without your white knight."" The familiar voice again, ""Please, I beg you... The Mists of Avalon. Meet me in the in between place.""",583994
2834,"I could hear the whispers. ""Ne, ne... are Miyazawa-san and Arima-kun dating?"" ""Aren""t they a great looking couple?"" ""If Miyazawa-san starts dating Arima-kun, there""s no hope for the rest of us..."" ""They look perfect..."" We arrived at our room after talking about inconsequential things, and she thanked me for the escort before quickly heading to her desk to review her notes before class. She was such conscientious student. I sat down at my own desk, and glanced across at her. The guys who usually hung around me materialized, waiting for me to say something. Unlike usual, I voiced my actual thoughts, rather then censoring myself. ""Miyazawa-san sure is great,"" I said admiringly. ""She seems good and I can""t find any faults with her,"" I confessed. I had spent the entire night before thinking about her, wondering why I was becoming obsessed, and came to the conclusion that it was because she was everything I wanted. Perfection. The thing I sought most of all. ""Incredible that such a person exists,"" I mused, almost whispering. I had almost forgotten my audience. Two of them looked at me with disbelief and no small amount of disgust. ""HUH?"" They pouted, actually pouted. ""What are you saying, Arima?"" the first one asked. ""It""s like you""re describing about yourself,"" the second one echoed. ""Huh?"" I said. I had been thinking of Miyazawa, not myself. I did not see myself as perfect, merely as someone who worked hard to maintain a good image and good relations. They immediately started to tick off the qualities I worked so hard to present to the world. ""You topped the entrance exam!"" ""You""re great at sports!"" ""You""re handsome!"" ""Your personality is good!"" ""In all, you""re the most popular person in class!"" ""YOU""RE PERFECT, AREN""T YOU?"" they yelled, uncaring of the attention they were attracting. ""Eh?"" I said, because I was unable to think of anything saner to say. The last thing I wanted was for this uncomfortable spotlight to be shined on me. I didn""t want people to examine me too closely for fear they would see the emptiness and darkness within. One of them started yanking out his hair, and I fleetingly wondered if he was going to give himself bald patches. ""How can you be impressed by somebody else?"" he yelled, spinning around comedically The other looked at me like he thought I was nuts. ""Didn""t you know that everybody in this school knows about you, Arima?"" he asked my solicitously, the way he would have ask a man in his dotage. ""R-really?"" I stammered. I didn""t like all this attention, though it was what I was used to. I could feel Miyazawa""s eyes on me from across the room, and I wished I could explain to her that I wasn""t asking for this. I doubted that she would approve- Miyazawa didn""t strike me as the type who would approve of this sort of foolishness. ""Like a perfect match for Miyazawa-san!"" the first one declared. I could hear the hearts in his voice, and I prayed to whatever deity was listening that Miyazawa hadn""t heard him. From the tense set of her shoulders, I was willing to wager the family business she had. ""You got that right!""",1112924
73,"And the line went dead. I stared at my phone, eyebrow raised. That man had to be the strangest person I""d ever... not technically met yet. But it was done. Zen had no idea I was already on the way to his place. Then, as if that thought had summoned him, my phone went off again. ""Ah, you picked up right away, jagiya~! Did you miss me?"" My heart beat like a drum. Whether from general nervousness, my anxiety, or talking to him right after my call with Luciel, I didn""t know, ""H-hi, Hyun."" ""Ah? You sound a little... off,"" His voice dropped in that way it did when he was worried, ""Aya, everything okay?"" ""Yes, yes!"" I said a little too quickly, ""Sorry, just finished practicing some dancing. I""m a little tired."" The lie didn""t roll off my tongue quite as smoothly as I""d""ve liked, but after a moment of silence Zen appeared to buy it, ""... I would have loved to have seen that."" ""Well, I could dance at the party, you know,"" I said offhand, thankful he hadn""t caught on to my lie. ""I""d want you to dance for me, just me,"" I shivered at his tone. It was even lower, somehow light and husky at the same time, ""I looked up that dancer you mentioned. If I ever saw you dance like that... ahh, it would be hard to control myself, jagiya~!"" I rolled my eyes, ""You""re making me sound like some high-end dancing beauty, Hyun."" ""Well, you are."" My shoulders sagged, ""Says the man who has no idea what I look like."" ""Then tell me."" I blinked, ""What?"" He laughed, ""Describe yourself to me, since I can""t see you."" ""Um..."" I looked out the window again. I was still a bit from his house and had to be careful so I didn""t ruin the surprise, ""Dirt brown hair, blue eyes, stick thin with a chest disproportionate to my frame, shoulders too square, and a cleft chin. Just an ugly American, really."" ""I don""t believe you,"" He laughed, ""That was the most self-deprecating description I""ve ever heard."" ""You""ll see at the party, I guess,"" or in five minutes. But he didn""t know that. The limo was getting close, so I hastily added, ""I""ve got to go, Hyun. Errands to run at um... The college."" ""Hmm... Why do I get the feeling you""re hiding something, jagiya?"" He chuckled, ""But alright. I""ll talk to you later, Aya, my sweet~."" I said goodbye and hung up, unable to keep the deep blush off my cheeks. I""d known sweet talkers before, but this man took the cake. I held a hand up to my burning cheeks and switched on the chatroom, only to see Zen railing against the ""sudden dozen cat pictures"" making his nose itch. I laughed, and the limo slowly came to a stop. The divider to the driving cabin slid open, ""We have arrived, Ms. Aya."" ""I uh... Thank you, Mr. Kim,"" I rubbed the fabric of my skirt, suddenly feeling self conscious. I was here. Looking out the window of the limo, I saw his apartment building. It was much smaller than the 15 floor downtown monstrosity I lived in. There were these little bushes around, and a door leading downward. Zen""s apartment was half basement, so I guessed that""s where I needed to go. The limo door slid open and Mr. Kim stood back so I could climb out.",748687
829,"Flashback During his childhood, D found himself many times in this position. He was shirtless, chained up and at the mercy of his father. On the sidelines, Renfield stood ready with two wires hooked up to a pair of car batteries. Dracula had no sense of fashion, he just dressed however he wanted. Today he was dressed up like an overdramatic version of a World War Two era American lieutenant, officer""s cap perched to the side of his head. The only part of Dracula""s wardrobe that stayed the same were his stupid white gloves. D had been in his room, just reading. D liked to read, it was one of his favorite pastimes. D loved romance novels. It was his favorite thing to see people fall in love and to see love overcome adversity. His father on the other hand, preferred to read about tales of wanton butchery and slaughter. It was as if Dracula couldn""t fit enough violence and cruelty in his life and so he tried to fit as much of it as he could into his reading list. Numerous times, Dracula would give his favorite books to his son to read. These books turned D""s stomach with their gruesome and quite often bizarre content. D wanted to cry, it was because of his father""s need to control every aspect of his son""s life that he was now burning his son""s collection of books. Dracula spoke down to his son as he threw books onto the barbecue, ""The Twilight series, The Vampire Chronicles, The Nightworld novels and a dozen other sickeningly saccharine books that ought to make any self respecting vampire puke his guts out. How you""re able to read these and other estrogen charged books is beyond me."" D wanted to talk tough but he just couldn""t get the words out the way he wanted them too, ""Please don""t burn them, I like those books."" Dracula leered, ""If you liked shoving a tampon up your ass I wouldn""t allow you to keep on doing that. From now on, you""ll only read books that I approve of and you""ll grow into a proper vampire."" ""But I""m not a vampire, I""m a dhampir!"" D fought the tears as Interview with the Vampire was thrown into the flames with Midnight Sun. The Sacred Ancestor had to concede with his son, ""You are not a full blown vampire, but you drink blood and that""s good enough for me."" D pleaded with his papa, ""What about mother, what does she have to say about this?"" More books went up in flame, ""Your mother was the one that tipped me off to these foolish works. She""s ashamed that you""re filling up your head with romantic fantasies such as these."" Mother had betrayed him. Mother was always there to shield him from father""s depravity, now D saw that he didn""t even have that anymore. He started to openly cry even though he was fifteen years old. ""He""s crying. Hit him again, Renfield!"" D stopped crying when his father""s servant electrocuted him. Crackling electricity and fire made the perfect accompaniment to D""s howls of pain. End Flashback D really didn""t remember much of what Asenath did. She gave him a blowjob, it was a good one. What D really did care about was the fact that in mid blowjob a vision had come to him.",1220273
239,"Digger looked at Travis and said, ""Seemingly, I think your first battle will be a breeze."" ""How so?"" ""Same thing for me. We did this before we were crowned the Guardians of Ga""hoole and there""s no doubt you can be one too."" ""Really?"" Travis asked, excitedly. ""It depends."" ""Well, okay."" Ezylryb looked at Travis and said, ""You are ready."" ""Am I, really?"" ""Yes. You are."" All of the Guardians are ready to fly to St. Aggie""s to start another war and they""re ready to break out another battle. Boron lead them with Barran and they all flew out of Ga""hoole and when the time came, Soren, Travis, Gylfie, Otulissa, Digger, Twilight and Ezylryb flew behind them as they followed them to St. Aggie""s. Travis became extremely excited, but started to feel nervous and said, ""I hope I know what I""m doing..."" ""You will. You""re ready."" Soren said. ""I""m looking forward to be the new Guardian."" ""I strongly believe you will."" Will Travis"" training pay off? We""ll see! What you all have been waiting for! Chapter 11: Attack! As soon as the Guardians got to St. Aggie""s, they were prepping for something on how they""ll attack. Soon, Soren, Gylfie, Twilight, Digger, Otulissa, Ezylryb and Travis all went to the top of the mountain, hoping to have a plan in the works. TRavis panted heavily and asked, ""How do we want to fight them?"" ""Some of the tytos might show up and see you there and once he does, attack him in any form."" Ezylryb said. ""Won""t that be dangerous?"" asked Travis. ""Yes. Just remember your training."" ""And do not worry. We will catch them off-guard and they won""t stand a chance against us."" Otulissa spoke out. ""And...what about Kludd?"" ""What about him?"" ""You know if he sees me with you, he""ll literally devour me in shreds."" ""Well, he""ll have to get through us first."" Digger said. ""Oh, sure. And then what-dig a hole?"" asked Twilight. ""Hey, just because I dig holes doesn""t mean you have to give stupid comments about it."" ""And how can Kludd take down someone like you?"" ""He doesn""t know what I got."" ""We""ve battled St. Aggie""s before and there""s no doubt we can do it again. All we have to do is come up with something."" Gylfie said. ""And how are we gonna do that?"" asked Travis. Soren became silent for a while and he told them, ""We lure him back to our side."" ""Are you crazy? He will literally kill you."" ""I know my brother. He needs me. I have to save him."" ""Aren""t we supposed to fight him and then bring him to his death?"" ""We don""t have to bring him to his death anymore. At least, I don""t. He""s my brother. I have to save him from Nyra""s clutch."" ""You mean talons?"" ""Same thing."" ""I just hope you know what you""re doing."" All of a sudden, one tyto seeks Travis standing with the Guardians and decides to wait until he""s alone so he can defeat him. Boron flies towards them and calls out for Ezylryb and Otulissa. Both of them looked at Travis and wished him good luck and flies off with him. Boron tells the others, ""Keep an eye out. They can be anywhere."" Twilight, Digger, Gylfie and Soren went with them, leaving Travis alone to see if he can use his training methods to use.",1276465
2066,"She had the same thing going threw her head, ""she couldn""t help her.' Okay this is all I can get out right now. I had to give the movie up again so I have to wait till I get it again. I promise the next chapter will be more amazing. Anyway goodnight, good morning, or good evening. Either way...BYE. PLEASE REVIEW NO FLAMES Crawling In My Skin Andy got off the helicopter with Magneto holding her like a child as if she would fall. Andy was still shaken up from the vision she had had and she was very wary about being here. She could feel Jeans presence, or more so the Phoenix""s presence. It was angry, confused, and vengeful. She shouldn""t be alive it wasn""t right. This was going to throw everything and everyone off balance. The more Andy thought about it, the more Andy wanted to turn around and run back to Xavier. To bad she saw him pulling up in a car though. The brotherhood took their place as Magneto and Andy walked toward Storm, Logon, and Xavier. Andy felt Xavier""s eyes traveling to her. She could hear him in her mind. ""Turn back Andy, this is not your place."" ""Yes it is! She""s my mother."" ""Not anymore child. She is...something else."" ""She may be, but Jean is somewhere in there. She""s calling me, and I can feel her."" ""Leave Andy,"" Xavier said out loud surprising both Storm and Logon. However Magneto ignored this as he said, ""You were right Charles. This one is special."" ""What the hell are you doing here,"" Logon said accusingly toward Andy more than Magneto. ""Coming for my mom,"" Andy said dryly, surprising Storm who had no clue what was going on. ""Mom?"" Storm said cocking her head and that""s when she realized how similar Andy was to Jean. They were practically identical. They could have been mistaken for twins if Andy had looked like this before Jean had supposedly died. Storms eyes widen as she realized the story that the Jean had told her years ago was real. Aaron had gotten her pregnant when they were both young and foolish. Jean had gone away for 9 months and came back sadder than ever saying that everything was fixed. ""I know why she is,"" Logon began, but then looked up at Magneto, ""But why are you."" Logon seemed to growl these words as he glared at Magneto. ""Same as the professor, visiting an old friend,"" Magneto said with a smirk plastered on his face. ""I don""t want trouble here Erik,"" Xavier began. ""Nor do I Charles,"" Magneto said looking over at Andy to see her contorted face. Jean was still trying to contact her, but was failing miserably as the Phoenix was slowly conquering her. Andy knew it would help if she reached out, but she was afraid to. She was afraid that if she tried, the Phoenix would destroy her mentally. That""s why she didn""t dare do so. ""So shall we three go inside,"" Magneto said patting a hand on Andy""s shoulder letting her know that she was to be with them to help calm Jean down, if that was even possible. Magneto and Andy began walking toward the house as Xavier followed behind them. ""I""ve come to bring Jean home, Erik, and even Andrea. Don""t interfere Erik,"" Xavier said looking directly at Andy as he said this.",806976
1657,"His Force-Sensitivity was superfluous though, as the honesty of her emotions were broadcasted all around her-through the curve of her mouth, the slight wrinkles in her forehead, the tenderness of her eyes. The old woman placed her free hand on top of Satine""s and Obi-Wan felt as though he should look away, like he was intruding on an intensely private moment. Too soon, the brief minute of shared grief had passed, and the two women began to chat about lighter topics. Obi-Wan found his mind wandering. Not far though, as it remained firmly fixed on the woman beside him. No matter which way he looked at it, she was an anomaly. In the course of his padawan training, he had encountered numerous politicians from all over the galaxy, but none of them were like her. In his experience, politicians were loud, brash, and domineering. That, he supposed, was the standard in a democratic system where one had to participate in a certain level of self-promotion in order to get elected. Perhaps her differences-her softness and quiet dignity-could be attributed to her inherited title, then, but that didn""t sit right with Obi-Wan either. She was so much more than her birthright, interacting with her subjects as a friend, not a ruler. There was something infuriating about her. Never had he met someone so stubborn and intransigent, a person who was fundamentally good, yet fiercely critical of the Jedi Order. Qui-Gon handled it better than Obi-Wan, smiling at her critiques and softly correcting misconceptions. No doubt it was due in part to his Master""s own issues with the Jedi Council. Obi-Wan on the other hand, would get annoyed and too blustered to properly argue. He""d stand there awkwardly, unable to come up with a good answer. He couldn""t stand it-despite everything, some part of him wanted to impress her. With that thought, quiet warning bells went off his in head. ""Well, Ben?"" Her words jerked him back into reality. She was smiling up at him, and It took Obi-Wan a minute to respond to the name Satine had taken to calling him when they were in public. ""Huh?"" The old woman chuckled and muttered something to the Duchess in Mando""a, which Obi-Wan took to mean something along the lines of: ""men."" ""Think this is enough?"" Satine gestured to the counter of the booth, and Obi-Wan saw that there was a sizable portion of food stacked up. For the second time in as a many minutes, Obi-Wan""s cheeks burned as he realized that he had effectively tuned out their entire purpose in coming to town. He quickly muttered his assent, and, not meeting the old woman""s amused eyes, helped Satine load the food into their packs. Once they had finished, Satine reached into her pocket and pulled out a number of Mandalorian coins and tried to hand them to the old woman. The woman refused the full amount, instead selecting two of the smaller ones from the Duchess""s hand and pocketing those. Satine tried to argue, but the old woman leaned back on her stool and smiled, holding firmly to her position. ""It""s the least I can do to help young love,"" she said, winking at Obi-Wan.",2943978
1995,"""Any of the students I mentioned on this list will come to the auditorium tomorrow morning and the school administrator will decide their punishment for this. That is all.""

Now you""re about to see how far Jesse would go to so something about Lars. I may warn you; this may include some heavy violence. Chapter 14: Taking a Stand The next morning came around and Jesse arrived in the front of Whoville High a few minutes early before it opens and when he and his gang arrived thee, he saw some of the students that were mentioned had arrived already, ready to wage revenge on Lars. ""Damn, you guys made it fast."" Jesse said, surprised. One who brought in his gun and other random weapons in his case and became fully armed and said, ""That Mexican asshole had the balls to turn us in the principal yesterday. He shouldn""t have belong there in the first place."" All of the others agreed on that and Marshall was amazed at how much hatred that have for Lars and one female who said, ""Well...if that smart-ass principal won""t kick him out, we will!"" ""What if some of his friends come in and stop us?"" another jock asked. Jesse lets out a sinister chuckle and brought in his machine gun, knife and some tear gas and replied, ""I""ll handle them."" Devon walked over to them and he asked, ""Who wants Lars gone?"" All of them cheered loudly as they raised their fists and weapons to gain revenge on Lars and they don""t care if anyone stops them because they""re willing to do whatever they can to make Lars"" life more miserable. Jesse got into the middle of the pavement and he said, ""We all agree. Let""s raise hell."" It didn""t take long before Lars actually showed up and when he stepped inside the school, he was shocked to see some of the students that have discriminated him have come for revenge and he didn""t know what was going on and asked, ""What are you doing here?"" None of them even bothered to answer his question and all they had to focus on was starting a huge riot anytime soon and just then, Jesse stepped in and he said, ""You have the freakin"" nerve to turn us all in because we discriminate you?! That stupid-ass principal can do whatever the hell he wants. We can still mess you up."" Lars didn""t like where this was going and he said, ""This is not right. Haven""t you ever heard of equality?"" ""That""s a load of bull! It means nothing to all of us!"" Marshall shouted, getting on Lars"" face. Two female whos came along and they got to Lars and one of them said, ""Your parents should never have moved in here in the first place. You mexicans are all the same; undocumented immigrants that have crossed here illegally."" Lars didn""t need to take this and as he walks away from them, Jesse sees this as a threat and he said, ""Attack the mexican!""",1276465
1474,"Nothing he could say or do would help Claude and he knew that. A very upset Ginger came up the spiral staircase leading her brother by the hand. She pushed past Jacques and tugged at the sleeve of Claude""s robes. ""Father Claude, why did Esmeralda go away? Didn""t she want us anymore?"" Jacques cringed. The poor thing...she may as well have stabbed Claude through the heart with a dagger. Claude was unable to speak, unable to even look at Ginger. ""Oh, sweetheart,"" Jacques sighed, ""of course she did...she didn""t leave because of anything that you, Andrew, or any of the rest of us did...she left because a couple of cold-hearted men chased her off."" ""Why can""t we just bring her back?"" Ginger asked, her tone taking on a slight whine. ""I wish it were that simple,"" Jacques sighed, ""but they won""t let her in. She""ll get in trouble and so will we."" ""Then let""s run away! The king man said we could go stay at his house anytime we wanted!"" Ginger said triumphantly. There was no response from Claude, who was still shuddering and shaking silently. ""Don""t cry, Father, we""ll fix it somehow, won""t we, Andrew?"" Jacques couldn""t help but smile when Claude pulled both of them into a tight hug. ""I love you both so much,"" he choked out, ""you have such good hearts...if only the rest of the world was like you."" He wiped his face with the sleeve of his robes. ""Please don""t run away,"" he begged, ""it""s bad enough that Esmeralda left. I""d worry too much with you gone."" ""All right,"" Ginger sighed. Eventually, Claude requested some time to be alone and left. Ginger and Andrew didn""t play, preferring to try and come up with ways to get Esmeralda back or ways to get Claude to go to her. Meanwhile, Jehan didn""t give up easily, either. ""If I get my hands on that cowardly little donkey""s ass Joseph, I""ll tear him limb from limb! I know he had to have said something...the question is how on earth did he get out of the dungeon?"" He and Jacques were pacing back and forth in the library. Out here, they could see Claude in the garden, though he wasn""t in his ""secret spot"" right now. Despite the afternoon sun, Claude had never looked so gloomy. There may as well have been dark clouds over Notre Dame. ""The bishop himself let Joseph out,"" explained Jacques, ""the reason for his visit in the first place was to find out why Joseph had gotten imprisoned. Unfortunately, the bishop sees Captain Phoebus in a different light than we do. Thankfully, Joseph didn""t sing his praises enough to let Phoebus go free. Since there""s an obvious dissent between Claude and Joseph, it""s decided that Joseph will be sent somewhere else."" ""Good. I better never see him again,"" Jehan growled, ""no one harasses my brother but me!"" He sighed, looking down at Claude. ""Look at him! He""ll never make it without that girl! He""ll die of a broken heart!"" Jacques nodded. ""It""s very unfortunate,"" he sighed, ""I love Claude Frollo as if he were a brother of mine as well.

Is it ""special effects""?"" Ranma has a tear in his eye and decides to tell Ukyo... (A traumatic flashback begins from chapter 1 involving the death of Mr. and Mrs. Saotome being witnessed by Ranma and what he went through to become Girlman in order to avenge their deaths, such as being cursed on purpose for his alter-ego) Ranma then says, ""The only ones who know about what I went through after that are Akane, Kasumi, and Rin the girl scout, she inspired me to use the girl as a symbol of terror to crime an... are you crying ""Uuchan""?""",910821
3787,"It was a plain brown brick building, but the owner had attempted to spruce it up with flowerbeds overflowing with brightly colored pansies. There were several children""s toys outside some of the doors. I hope I don""t get one next to a bunch of kids. From what he""d seen, human children were loud, unruly, and annoying. He had no desire to be around them. The manager was a middle-aged woman with red hair and glasses. She wore a blue outfit and seemed tired beyond belief. She also looked down her nose as though she thought Blackheart wasn""t good enough for this place. ""Well, this seems to be your lucky day,"" she sniffed, ""we""ve had a client evicted about a month ago and he never came to retrieve his things, so you can have his place and whatever""s there that you want. Rent is due at the first of the month, no excuses."" She tossed the key onto the counter and went chasing after a kid that was throwing water balloons at people who were coming in. Blackheart took the key and wandered off. The first thing he noticed was that the door seemed to stick. He pressed his shoulder against it and managed to get it open. Then, he could only stare. It looked as though the last occupant of this place had just had a wild party. There were beer cans and bottles everywhere. The place reeked of alcohol and old food. Furniture had been tipped over in places. The barrier that had made the door hard to open was an overturned recliner. The only thing in here that didn""t look like it had been touched was a shelf full of books. The kitchen was by far the worst room in terms of cleanliness. Blackheart was no neat freak by far, but the smell would kill him if he had to deal with it too much more. It made his breakfast rise in his throat a little bit. Then, a familiar scent caught his nose. The smell of sin was thick around the bedroom. He opened that door. Immediately, he could tell why. The covers on the bed were twisted and half-off the bed. He could detect the scent of the former occupant and four or five different women. He smirked as he wondered if they had all been here in the same night. It took all day to get the disgusting stuff out. There were about five or six trash-bags full of beer bottles and cans and bad food. He left the windows open while he was working so that the place would air out. He was tired by the time he decided to spend one more night at Pam""s and knew this wouldn""t help with work in the morning. Luckily, Pam was too busy to see him come in and he didn""t have to talk to her. Morning, as always, came too soon. He groaned slightly when the alarm on his cell phone, but forced himself to get up anyway. At least he had his new place to look forward to when work was over. It would be nice to have a place to go where he could have some privacy. He got there just as ""rush hour"" as Dawn had affectionately named it started. Waves of zombie-like people who were just as tired as he was came forward. He couldn""t fill the cups fast enough although he was getting better.",870118
948,"""My sweet William,"" Ulrich began, ""you are not to remember anything of this afternoon until I take this padlock off."" William unconsciously glanced to the side, tightening his grip. He would do as Ulrich asked, but he would be lying if he said he wasn""t scared. It was one thing to follow orders, and William definitely trusted Ulrich with his life; after all, their time fighting X.A.N.A. in Lyoko had more than proven that. Although short of falling into the Digital Sea, ""death"" on Lyoko merely resulted into being devirtualized back into the real world. ""William?"" Ulrich prodded. After a beat, he continued, noticeably worried. ""Hey, look at me."" Ulrich asked gently. It wasn""t a command; he wasn""t asking to be in control. This was Ulrich, the man, and William""s lover. William looked up. ""You""ve never asked this of me before,"" he said, crossing his left hand over his body to grab at his right arm. His grip was so tight, that it took Ulrich""s hand placed over his to make William let go. ""I""m just reminded of my time with X.A.N.A., and it scares me,"" he admitted. William felt his mind start to kick back into reality. ""No,"" Ulrich commanded. His mind fell back into Ulrich""s hands, but his fear remained. ""I""m not X.A.N.A. and I will never use you against your will."" Ulrich waited for William to catch his gaze. ""Know that I love you, William. Before collars, control and your submissive behavior. ""It""s only you, always, and I realized today that maybe its time I let the others know about us."" Ulrich exhaled slowly. ""When Aelita and Jeremie were finally able to meet, after all this time... they looked so happy to finally be able to hold each other in the physical world. I thought about who mattered most to me, you or Yumi."" William gave a short smile. ""I""m not making you choose. A submissive doesn""t require their Dominant to be their lover."" ""But I would be blind if I didn""t see how much attention you paid to my relationship with Yumi."" Ulrich tilted his head. ""The hopeless look you get in your eyes when you think I""m not looking, when you think you""ll never be able to compare."" William shook his head again. This half-in half-out of Ulrich""s control was slowing his response times, it seemed. ""I like Yumi, as a friend,"" William said. ""And maybe to occasionally antagonize you."" He shrugged. ""You are cute when your jealous."" Ulrich sighed. ""You""re deflecting."" Without warning, Ulrich placed the leather posture collar around William""s neck. ""You trust me more than X.A.N.A,"" Ulrich said, his voice taking on a soothing, melodic tone. ""I don""t love Yumi, I know that now."" William closed his eyes. The soft, inner lining of the collar and Ulrich""s hands brushing against his neck felt so familiar. Safe. Memories of Ulrich saving his life flooded his mind. This man would do anything to keep his friends and loved ones safe-William felt Ulrich""s fingers reaching for the buckles on the back of his collar. Ulrich hesitated. ""Maybe... maybe I-"" ""I never loved X.A.N.A,"" William interrupted.",583994
3088,"Why was he thinking so much about it anyway? There was still a whole world of girls waiting for him, and he wasn""t Craven""s age just yet. Was he really ready to say that Monique was the greatest catch of them all? Unfortunately for Randy, his mind wasn""t given the chance to answer that question. The sound of someone knocking a heavy object over alerted him almost immediately, and he bolted out of his cot and up a flight of stairs towards the upper part of the Heat-Seeker. Peeking around a corner, Randy could see a dark shape moving around ahead. It almost looked as if it was rummaging through the equipment near the main controls of the boat, but Randy couldn""t be exactly sure due to the low lighting. Not once to take chances however, the hacker decided he was going to take matter into his own hands. Holding a flashlight in one hand, Randy made a daring leap at the intruder, and he actually managed to bring whoever it was to the floor. He wrestled against strength much greater than his own, but managed to get his light on the intruder""s face. All it showed him was the surprised face of Monique as she realized it was Randy that had actually overpowered her, if only for a mere moment. ""This is some sort of joke, non..."" Monique said in embarrassment, but Randy felt more amused by the situation more than anything else. ""It could also be a dream come true. I""m certainly not complaining."" Randy said with a grin, but his comment only earned him a strong kick to the stomach, which knocked him off Monique and onto his back a couple feet away. ""I would appreciate it if you didn""t interfere, Randy. Go back to sleep and...how do you say...don""t let the bed bugs bite."" she told him, but her command seemed to have the opposite effect, furthering a growing curiosity in him. ""I""m not sleeping anytime soon, you can be sure of that. "", Randy replied as he turned on a nearby light, revealing the fact that Monique had already put on a skin-tight scuba suit. ""You look ready to go for a swim."" he stated with a smile. ""I am doing what Dr. Tatopoulos should have done earlier today. I am going to find this mutation and do what is necessary. Unlike some of you, I have my priorities straight."" Monique shot back in a cold tone. ""Count me in then. I""m always up for monster hunting with a hot babe by my side."" Monique""s temper was beginning to flare the more Randy challenged her authority, ""You will only be a liability. Go back to sleep, Randy."" ""Oh, I""m not so sure about that. I wonder...Jefe! Somebody""s sneak-"" Randy attempted to finish, but Monique""s hand was over his mouth and he could feel her breath on his neck. ""You are not to say one word, understand? And in return, I will change my decision and allow you to join me."" ""That""s my girl."" Randy teased, but Monique grabbed him roughly by the collar and stared him down with a fierce look in her eyes. The color drained from his face, and his smile quickly disappeared, replaced by a much more worried expression. ""I just hope you realize that I have no obligation to protect you.",967934
3153,"His eyes scanned all around the room, anxious to spot any sight of Satuki emerging in her bathrobe. This kind of thing was nothing new. Gamagoori himself was most aware of the kendo master""s lack of discipline in matters like this. It amazed Gamagoori to no end, that Sanageyama was able to be so focused and so diligent when it came to the art of sword-fighting, but there were so many other things that the boy just didn""t want to make time for. Jakazure simply saw Sanageyama as the same fidgety monkey she remembered when Satsuki first approached them all about her dream of creating Honnoji Academy. It did sometimes boggle her mind just that the boy couldn""t be as focused on some things as focused as he was on the art of the sword. For the last of the Elite Four, Sanageyama""s personality flaws were of little concern. Of course, Inumuta kept them in his records, but he seldom thought about them. Still, those records did note that Sanageyama, despite his inherent skills and masterful insights, was still a bit immature and retained aspects from his personality from his bancho days long ago. For another five minutes, the Elite Four waited in utter silence, as Gamagoori often preferred. But despite the Disciplinary Chair""s expectations, Sangeyama could not remain silent any longer, stretching as he stood up from his seat. ""Alright. I""ve had enough sitting idle. Inumuta, I need your assistance."" Sanageyama declared, causing Inumuta to stop typing for a brief moment and raise a questioning eyebrow. ""For...what, exactly?"" the blue-haired boy asked, before pushing his glasses up with two fingers. ""I need you to tap into the Academy""s security cameras."" Sanageyama said as he stood behind Inumuta, hand over his chin as he contemplated what he was about to see. ""Particularly the ones right outside the tennis court."" ""What could be so important that you need to interrupt this silence, Sanageyama? I strive to discipline myself in these calm moments."" Gamagoori questioned, but the kendo master didn""t even turn his gaze as he replied. ""I need to see if the seeds I""ve planted have bore fruit. You can understand that."" Sanageyama watched with a smile as Inumuta pulled up the security camera to the tennis court, revealing the chaos that was occurring as Omiko Hakodate simultaneously put her new members and the Tennis Tartarus to the test. As Inumuta and Sanageyama watched, they could see the sight of No-Star girls attempting to navigate through the maze of tennis-based deathtraps while attempting to keep their tennis ball, and themselves, in one piece. ""What a marvelous piece of architecture."" Inumuta, commented, fixing his glasses again as he focused the camera in closer. Sanageyama made a satisfied smile at the sound of one No-Star girl screaming in terror, as she attempted to outrun the concentrated machine-gun fire of one of the multiple tennis ball turrets, only to fail quite miserably. ""Definitely. The Obstacle Course Construction Club has defied expectations."" Sanageyama said with a grin.",967934
3590,"She then breaks her stoic character and starts to laugh. Femme Fortress 2 Hope you enjoyed that :) next time on this story we have the soldier and boy am I looking forward to her! Femme Fortress 2: Meet the Soldier Author""s note: I do not own any of the intellectual properties portrayed in this. This is a pure non profit venture. Now enjoy We are back now at 2Fort, where a Camera crew is interviewing the Demo and the Heavy. Demo picks at some sliced avocados in a Tupperware container and talks about her comrade. ""Truthfully, everything about the Soldier offends me; everything."" ""But,"" Heavy interjects, ""She""s the only one here who has a driver""s license. For better or for worse she""s the only way we have to reach the nearest liquor store. The scene cuts to a woman in her mid-fifties wearing a British army uniform; her iron grey hair tied in a tight knot under her beret. The Soldier is very tall and needs to duck down to avoid hitting her head on the top of the door frame; her face blocked by a crate she""s carrying. Suddenly, Soldier puts down the crate and sees the camera. ""Hello!"" she shouts at the camera louder than necessary. Soldier is trying to be friendly but the effort is undone by her huge, bulging eyes and psychotic smile. She""s a bony, hatchet faced woman with crooked but white teeth. A decade ago she might have been pretty if she didn""t always look like she was getting a murder-boner. As she talks, Soldier rapidly moves her head from side to side and waves her hands as if telling a very interesting story. ""Here I am, working for the Red Team."" We cut to the battlefield where Soldier is standing by a dispenser while firing a hail of bullets down at the Blue team from her Sten machinegun. It looks like she""s orgasming with every bullet she fires from her gun. Back to soldier. ""Back in her Majesty""s army I loved murdering people with shotguns"" she somehow manages to grin even wider. In combat, the Heavy backing her up gets blown away by a sticky bomb, so a maniacally smiling Soldier draws the rocket launcher from her back and performs a rocket jump. Sailing through the air, she lands in the middle of an enemy squad. Among the fire and the blood splatter, she sprays everywhere with her Sten gun and yanks a large bowie knife from her belt holster and slices the throat of an enemy demo woman. When her Sten clicks dry, she grabs her rocket launcher again and rocket jumps, killing and maiming her foes with splash damage. Soldier holds up a finger as she talks about her history. ""When Mann co hired me, I celebrated by chopping my dad""s bollocks off."" In combat, Soldier jumps into a makeshift catapult built by the Engineer. The ramshackle contraption is held together by duct tape and the will of god. Soldier gives engineer the thumbs up, squealing with excitement like a little girl. With a smile back engineer flips the switch and soldier goes sailing through the air and flies face first through a window in the blue base. Soldier smiles and adjust her beret. ""I love my dad. I love screwing my dead dad.""",1220273
572,"She picked out a ring with a pretty pink stone."" Hunt took another sip and took a deep breath before continuing. ""I thought it was a sapphire, an expensive one, but I thought it was a sapphire. Until she started talking about our engagement in the car, if I""d known she was looking at pink diamonds I would""ve steered her away."" Sloan was confused. ""Don""t they label them? Didn""t you see the label?"" ""I was looking at her, not the jewelry. I only wanted out of the doghouse! I didn""t want to marry her, but you can""t really take that back. I was driving home trying to think of a way out if it, and there just isn""t one. I swear, I was the only guy in Iraq who was hoping his girl would cheat on him, so I""d have an easy out. I always knew I wasn""t going to marry her, but couldn""t figure out how to make-up for that pain. Only to realize there is no way."" ""I slept with my best friend""s wife."" Hunt looked to Sloan, the beer slowing his brain and needed an extra minute to remember the beginning of the night. When he finally nodded in understanding, Sloan continued, ""The man who was closer than a brother to me and I slept with his wife, even fell in love with her. There is no forgiving that. Not really. I mean we""re good now because he has Meredith, but the trust, it""ll never be like it used to."" Hunt waited for him to continue, and Sloan took another drink. ""I was always the screw-up, where he was always perfect. Even when he had problems and acted like a complete ass, he was perfect and I was the screw-up. Though I have my theories, I can only guess as to why he punched me, but I know why I punched him back."" Both men took a drink, enjoying the filling beer slide down their throats as they sat together in silence lost in their memories. The bar had filled since they first came in, and the noise covered any lapses in conversation. Mark was the one to break it. ""I could really go for some chicken wings right now, Buffalo style."" Owen looked up. ""Me too."" He checked the time at the bar. ""Doubt the kitchen""s still open here though."" ""Damn."" Mark finished his drink and brought back down on the table, hard. Owen finished his drink as well, but lowered his glass with much less force. He started to put on his coat. ""Come on, I know a place that has the best wings in Seattle, and it""s open late."" Mark started to put on his own jacket as Owen called a cab. They began to make their way to the door, in a not quite straight line. Mark pointed a finger at Owen, wanting to make something clear, ""I""m from New York, it""s going to take a lot to impress me."" Owen saw Mark stagger and put his hand on his arm to steady the other man, much like he did after the fight. ""Oh, you might be surprised with Seattle."" A/N: I wrote nothing that is italized. Vows Preston Burke looked over his vows for the woman he was about to marry for the hundredth time. He changed a sentence and read them again. He felt like starting over once more.

3126,"Barely fifteen minutes later, they came out in a room. Like the first one, it was large, much larger than the passage way, but it was also lit. In the eerie glow of the torches swept along the walls, and Percy saw that they were in some kind of dungeon. Cells with rusty iron bars lined the walls. They went down farther than Percy could see. Cautiously, he leaned forward in order to look into the nearest one. To his relief it was empty. Looking around, he realized that all of the cells were empty, at least all the ones he could see. He tested the bars and saw that they were so rusted that they broke easily. This must have been some old abandoned part of Tartarus. Did Tartarus have abandoned parts? Percy had no idea. With all the monsters that had been on the lose for the past couple of months, it seemed possible... He screwed his head around to look at Annabeth. She shrugged her shoulders as well as she could while hanging on to Percy to show she didn""t know what was up with the empty cells and more than he did. ""Well this seems like a place as good any to sleep,"" he said. Annabeth nodded. Percy went into the nearest cell and put Annabeth down, hoping that if anything attacked them the bars could serve as some sort of protection. ""Are you good?"" He asked. She nodded again, and rested her head against his shoulder breathing heavily. Noticing her I""m-in-pain-but-I""m-too-strong-and-proud-to-admit-it look, Percy fished out the bag of Ambrosia. Giving her another dose this soon could be dangerous, but enough time had probably passed, and if her expression was anything to go by, she needed it. ""Here,"" he said, breaking off a small corner of the divine food and handing it to her. ""Thanks."" She ate it quickly. Looking at the ambrosia in his hand, Percy felt his stomach growl and he remembered that he hadn""t eaten anything since they""d fallen into Tartarus. Picking up a square, he looked it over, drool practically falling out of his mouth as the smell of freshly baked cookies wafted to him. ""Hey, Annabeth, do you know if this stuff can be substituted at real food?"" he asked. She frowned, looking at it. ""I don""t know. I""ve never had any need for it before now. But, now that I think about it, I""m not hungry. Logically, it should heal an empty stomach just like a wound. Try it in super small portions, just to be safe."" Percy anxiously nibbled the edge. Instantly, the taste of warm cookies exploded in his mouth. He swallowed, and at first nothing happened, but finally he started to feel something in his stomach. Slowly but surely the gripping pain of hunger was leaving. He smiled wide. ""Did it work?"" Annabeth asked, but his smile already told her the answer. ""Now, water."" ""That""s easy,"" Percy stated closing his eyes. It took some effort, but he finally located a small puddle of water about twenty feet away from them. Concentrating even harder, he brought it over to them. It was tougher than it should""ve been though, like something was smothering his power. ""Here,"" Percy said, cupping his hands and mentally pouring the water into them.",2943978
3340,"Some remembered her as the kind, sweet Kikyo they had known or that they remembered with her mother and father, who were kind and respectable people. Other women envied her, saying she was too beautiful, and spread rumors about her that she was a witch and used spells to make herself beautiful, that she hungered for men and that was why she lived in the shrine with so many of them, that she herself wanted the Jewel to use it for her own purposes. And others still simply feared her and never spoke to her. Then, there were the children. The children alone were not afraid of her. They did not run when she drew near, nor did they say hurtful things about her. They all knew she was a kind woman, and often asked if they could help her in things like gathering herbs or keeping Keade safe while she was patrolling. These children were her sister""s friends, and Kikyo found them a joy. But it also reminded her of what she could not have as the keeper of The Sacred Jewel. She could not have her own children, to love and watch grow. She looked about at her old childhood companions and saw them either getting married and having children. She would sometimes wish to throw off the shackles of the Shikon Jewel. But she herself had chosen this life. Two years passed. One day, Kikyo was chasing a kappa away from the village. She ran after the wretched creature, using her powers to keep up with it""s speed. She stopped when she was in the forest, near the bone eaters well. Perfect. She got her bow, took an arrow, and aimed. She lined it up...just right. She released it! It flew through the trees, chasing it""s prey. She heard the ""thwonk"" of the arrow hitting the kappa in the back. As she went to retrieve the arrow and collect the bones to throw into the dry well, she looked over to the largest tree in the forest. A tree she knew well, for when she was a child she would seek it and sit under it""s boughs in summer. What she saw now, at first glance, appeared to be a young man, around her own age. He was asleep, and wore a red kimono. But then she had a closer look. He had white hair and...the ears of a dog. His hands, which lay on his stomach as he slumbered, were clawed. A dog demon. No, a true creature would have taken total human form. This one was obviously a half breed. And more than likely after the Jewel, to make complete it""s power. She got another arrow and prepared to kill it, but then, as she aimed, she looked at his face. So peaceful...so...handsome. She felt so strange. He was an evil thing, and would take the Jewel if she let it live. She had to do her duty. But she found she could not. She could not kill this sleeping boy. She lowered her bow and arrow. She turned, gathered up the bones of the kappa, and proceeded to the well. ""You are fortunate, half breed,"" she said quietly. ""But if you venture into my village, you will not be."" AN: This is the beginning of the end! I hope yall will review. Forgive the shortness of the chapters :-( Ch 5 Inu-yasha ""STOP!!"" Kikyo cried as she chased him through the village. His agility was extraordinary.",512464
3593,"His Force-Sensitivity was superfluous though, as the honesty of her emotions were broadcasted all around her-through the curve of her mouth, the slight wrinkles in her forehead, the tenderness of her eyes. The old woman placed her free hand on top of Satine""s and Obi-Wan felt as though he should look away, like he was intruding on an intensely private moment. Too soon, the brief minute of shared grief had passed, and the two women began to chat about lighter topics. Obi-Wan found his mind wandering. Not far though, as it remained firmly fixed on the woman beside him. No matter which way he looked at it, she was an anomaly. In the course of his padawan training, he had encountered numerous politicians from all over the galaxy, but none of them were like her. In his experience, politicians were loud, brash, and domineering. That, he supposed, was the standard in a democratic system where one had to participate in a certain level of self-promotion in order to get elected. Perhaps her differences-her softness and quiet dignity-could be attributed to her inherited title, then, but that didn""t sit right with Obi-Wan either. She was so much more than her birthright, interacting with her subjects as a friend, not a ruler. There was something infuriating about her. Never had he met someone so stubborn and intransigent, a person who was fundamentally good, yet fiercely critical of the Jedi Order. Qui-Gon handled it better than Obi-Wan, smiling at her critiques and softly correcting misconceptions. No doubt it was due in part to his Master""s own issues with the Jedi Council. Obi-Wan on the other hand, would get annoyed and too blustered to properly argue. He""d stand there awkwardly, unable to come up with a good answer. He couldn""t stand it-despite everything, some part of him wanted to impress her. With that thought, quiet warning bells went off his in head. ""Well, Ben?"" Her words jerked him back into reality. She was smiling up at him, and It took Obi-Wan a minute to respond to the name Satine had taken to calling him when they were in public. ""Huh?"" The old woman chuckled and muttered something to the Duchess in Mando""a, which Obi-Wan took to mean something along the lines of: ""men."" ""Think this is enough?"" Satine gestured to the counter of the booth, and Obi-Wan saw that there was a sizable portion of food stacked up. For the second time in as a many minutes, Obi-Wan""s cheeks burned as he realized that he had effectively tuned out their entire purpose in coming to town. He quickly muttered his assent, and, not meeting the old woman""s amused eyes, helped Satine load the food into their packs. Once they had finished, Satine reached into her pocket and pulled out a number of Mandalorian coins and tried to hand them to the old woman. The woman refused the full amount, instead selecting two of the smaller ones from the Duchess""s hand and pocketing those. Satine tried to argue, but the old woman leaned back on her stool and smiled, holding firmly to her position. ""It""s the least I can do to help young love,"" she said, winking at Obi-Wan.",2943978
3341,"She regretted letting this half-breed go the other day. He did indeed come to her village, and did try to steal the Jewel. But she had been on watch that day, and managed to stop him. ""I said stop, vermin!"" she cried, firing an arrow. ""And let you hit me?"" he said in a rough, almost growling voice. She chased him to the trees. There she stopped. She fired one last arrow at his retreating back. ""That is a warning,"" she called out. ""If you return, you will assuredly die, demon, spawn."" She turned around, heading back to the village. As she approached the shrine, Keade rushed up to her. ""Sister!"" the child called out, running up and hugging the priestess. ""Is he gone?"" ""He was too swift for me, little sister,"" Kikyo said, ""But, yes, for now he is gone, Keade."" ""Then come with me, sister,"" she said, leading Keade up the stairs. ""We will get our sacks and go to Naoto""s farm to pick up the rice for the shrine."" Meanwhile, the white haired half demon sat in the trees above, watching the priestess. He had watched her for less than a year now, trying to learn her moves so he could get the Shikon Jewel. He had been seeking the Jewel since autumn, when rumor first reached his ears that it was near by. He wasn""t impressed by this Kikyo. She seemed like any human he""d seen. He""d first seen her when she was attending some wedding ceremony in early fall. She did not look like a person who could protect a Jewel. But then, he stuck around and watched her. He remembered once, he had been scrounging around during winter. It had been snowing. And he saw her coming from river. She was covered in snow, and carried a bundle of hay over her head. He had watched her go into a solitary hut that lay far from the village, and come out again with nothing but a blanket wrapped around her shoulders. He had looked through the window of that hut later. The family inside was cooking fish, and the father had his arm in a sling, and they were saying praises for Kikyo and her act of kindness to them. Then, later when he had seen the hole in the icy river, and no fishing line in sight, he figured out that Kikyo had stuck her bare arms into the river and got that family food when the would have starved otherwise. But now, he saw a regular human woman running off with a skinny little brat. ""Some ""protectress""."" he mumbled as he leaped back into the forest. For several weeks, their encounters were like this. The white haired half-breed would try to steal the Jewel, and Kikyo would chase him away. Amid this, Kikyo had to fight other monsters. It was becoming a strain, now that summer was near. One day, she did not see the white haired one anywhere near the village. She hoped he was gone for good. That day, she went to the river to get water, her sister coming with her. She had told Keade that it was not safe to go into the forest alone, but Keade said that since she would be with Kikyo, there was no worry. But as Kikyo dropped a bucket into the water, she heard her sister scream. She turned, and saw her sister running from a demon panther.",512464

""Maybe you""ve got it the wrong way. She""s not you, so Brenda get up and let""s go and prove that brunettes are the ones that have more fun"" Brenda smiled at Steve""s joke and got up. The car ride to the Peach Pit was the longest one she ever had. Beverly Hills was pretty much the same, still hot as ever and crowded as ever. She glanced at a store that her and Kelly used to go to all the time. She would casually stare at Steve and he would stick his tongue out at her or make a face as a lame attempt to make her laugh. ""We""re here madam and madam""s friend"" ""Thanks Jeeves"" Brenda sat there in silence looking down at the floor of the red corvette while Steve and Dylan talked. ""Let""s go Bren"" Brenda heard Dylan call her but she couldn""t fight back the fear and doubt in the back of her head. ""I can""t"" Her voice was faint but they both heard it, Dylan went to go talk to her but Steve stopped him. ""Let me"" Steve hopped back in the car and sat next to Brenda. ""So my young chickadee what""s on that little pretty brain of yours?"" ""I can""t go in there, I can""t face them"" ""You can""t face Donna, David and Kelly the people you spent the good ol"" days with? What are you so afraid of?"" ""That I don""t fit in here anymore. That I was gone so long that their lives don""t combine with mine anymore."" ""Okay Brenda you""re not making any sense at all. Sure you were gone a long time but there was not one time that we weren""t friends. So get your booty in that little diner that we all love so much and show us that you can always go home"" Steve hopped out of the car reaching his hand out to Brenda, she put her own in his and they walked to the Peach Pit. ""Don""t go in yet"" Brenda stopped and stared at Steve.",29783
331,"Super excited about it. I""m practicing my lines right now. I know it""s late, but I don""t sleep all that much. Practicing my lines into the early hours is sort of what I do. *smiling emoji* I looked down at the coin skirt I was fastening around my hips. Just like me. With a small smile I replied, even though it""d been a few minutes. He was still in the chatroom, at least. [Aya]: Sorry, I was getting ready to practice too. [ZEN]: Eh?! *shocked emoji* Are you an actor too?! [Aya]: No, um... a dancer. And a musician. An artist, really. I didn""t know why I told him. Maybe it was the small hope of finding a kindred spirit here, with a love for art of all kinds. I couldn""t help but smile again at his enthusiasm. [ZEN]: Ahh, better and better! I""m a dancer myself; already told you I""m a musical theatre actor. Well, mostly. *smiling emoji* What""s your style? Waltz, modern? I mostly practice theatre dancing, given my job, but I do a beautiful tango... especially with a partner. *heart emoji* I rolled my eyes. [Aya]: A few styles, mainly belly dance and modern. Um... I am about to practice the... um... I am sorry, I do not know the Korean words, but it is called the Tribal Fusion style of belly dance. If you look up the dancer Irina Akulenko on YouTube, you can get an idea of it. I used to do a lot of tango and ballroom, but both usually require a partner and I... prefer dancing on my own. [ZEN]: Well, if you ever need a partner... *winking emoji* How did I know he was going to say that? I sighed. It had been a good few years since I could bring myself to stand up with a male partner. I""d managed it with my female dancing friends back in the States, but dancing with a male? It made me shiver and brought dark thoughts to my mind. But, wanting to keep the peace and not give too much away, I decided to play along. [Aya]: Hah, maybe one of these days casanova. [ZEN]: What""s that word mean? [Aya]: Tell me what jagiya means and I will. There was no answer, so I assumed he was busy and finished clearing out room, and started the music. It was calm and soothing, perfect for practicing isolation and slower choreography. I needed to keep my body in perfect shape if I wanted to succeed in classes. Even though my mind was in pieces... my body wouldn""t be. Ever again. Before I could begin, I caught his answer. [ZEN]: ... you really don""t know what jagiya means? I would""ve thought you""d have looked it up, then. Normally, yes. But my good translator was still packed somewhere, and I just hadn""t thought of noogling it yet. I typed as much in the chatroom. [ZEN]: Ahh, well I don""t know the equivalent word in English. I only know a few words of your language, myself. Mostly thing""s I""ve picked up from roles. It""s a term of endearment. Before I could butt in and ask exactly what that meant, he went on; [ZEN]: You mentioned music too; I know some piano myself, and obviously singing. What do you play? [Aya]: A few. Piano and violin, mainly. I used to sing, but not anymo- ghjks I froze. He didn""t need to know that.",748687
3611,"She, too, just stood there, staring back at him. It took them a few seconds to realize their distances, as they both instantly looked back down at the sink spontaneously. ""I""ll dry the dishes."" Mikasa said as she moved to where Armin was. She didn""t even wait for Eren""s reply. ""Sure."" the brunet said. Ah dammit. What was I supposed to say? Eren thought, scraping the dirt off the dishes with a sponge. Thus the two soldiers continued with the dishes in awkward silence. the _genius entered the chatroom the _genius added the _sniffer, the _commander and the_cleanfreak to the chatroom the _genius: Greetings everyone!

And that""s the first adjective that came to my mind when I thought of you. the_cleanfreak: Change it before I go there and slice you up like the nape of an abnormal. the _commander: I think we can discuss such matters in a later time, shall we Levi? the_cleanfreak: Whatever. the_cleanfreak: I am not helping that weirdo catch a titan ever again. the_genius: Oh come on Levi! I was just joshing with you! I""ll change it into something cooler, okay? the_genius: Just take back what you said please. the_cleanfreak: Depends on what you""ll come up next. the_genius: I assure you, you will love it. the_commander: I am sure Levi trusts your word on that, Hanji. the _cleanfreak: Trust is such a heavy word, commander. the_commander: Moving on, can I hear some status report regarding on the new invention? the_genius: The soldiers are actually maximizing the use of the messenger. I have seen them use them day and night. the_cleanfreak: They use it to deliver messages cabin to cabin. the_commander: How about you, Mike? Anything to report? the_sniffer: the kids are using it for their personal messages as well the_sniffer: there might be some intel being passed on the_genius: Good point, Mike. the_commander: Good observation, everyone. That would help us in improving the messenger. the_genius: Speaking of observation, I just saw Eren and Mikasa having quite a moment tonight. the_genius: god they look so cute the_cleanfreak: I will never understand how you find those brats cute. the_genius: THEY ARE! the_cleanfreak: You really are a freak. the_commander: At ease, Levi. the_commander: Hanji has a point though.

I had to make sacrifices just for humanity""s sake. And I made that decision with no regrets. the_sniffer: you did the logical thing, Erwin.

2321,"He wanted to hit her, and a moment after the thought crossed his mind, he despised himself for it. She said, ""You may not be the champion of truth, justice, and the American way, but are you really going to lie to me, superhero? We both know you""re blaming yourself for his death."" She leaned forward, ""Which is a crock of shit, by the way. Robin made his choices and paid the price. I sincerely doubt you didn""t make it clear from the beginning that being a vigilante isn""t like playing pretend on the playground, where the good guys always win and nothing bad ever happens to the determined child."" Bruce answered so quietly Selina almost didn""t hear him, ""I could""ve done more."" Selina didn""t know what to say to make him stop blaming himself, so she spread her dangling legs, took Bruce""s hands and pulled him between them, hugging him without really hugging him, giving him the only comfort he""d accept from her. Bruce stared at his hands, as Selina was still holding them. He asked, ""How did you find out?"" Selina""s eyes hadn""t left Bruce""s face. She answered, ""I told you, I just came from the Iceberg."" Bruce snorted and tried to remove his hands, but Selina wouldn""t let him. He was growling again, ""Joker bragging?"" Selina answered calmly, ""No. He""s still in the ICU. But tonight was the only night is was acknowledged among the Gotham Rogues that the Joker is the Batman""s greatest enemy."" Bruce inhaled and asked again, ""Why are you here, Selina?"" She shrugged, ""I thought you""d be lonely."" What an infuriating response. Still, Bruce didn""t remove his hands. Until his eyes drifted to her thighs, her perfect, leather incased thighs. He let his hands drift to those thighs, caressing them softly. She didn""t stop him. And when he grew tired of that, his hands drifted to her waist, where he fingered her whip for a moment before asking, ""Why a whip?"" Selina""s eyes had been closed and her breathing controlled, but she opened them at the question, ""What?"" Bruce voiced a question that had always plagued him, ""Is it the kinky sex thing?"" Selina smiled softly. ""No. Unlike a knife or a gun, a whip isn""t a common weapon or easy to use. It takes years of training to be half as good as I am with it, so if an opponent was to disarm me, chances are they wouldn""t be able to use it against me."" Bruce""s brow furrowed with the new information. ""That makes sense."" ""Of course it does. I don""t know where you got the idea I was unintelligent."" One corner of his lips turned upward for a brief second. Selina nearly broke out in a grin at the sight of it. Bruce""s deep blues tore through Selina""s emerald greens, but she didn""t look away or flinch. He fingered the edge of her cowl, ""I want to see your face."" Selina didn""t hesitate to remove her cowl, she threw it aside on the keyboard of the Bat computer. Bruce moved his hands from her face to finger her hair. Selina enjoyed the feeling, but was acutely aware of how large his hands were as they could almost encompass her head. Not only that, but Bruce""s hands were Batman""s hands, they could crush her skull if he placed them just so...",1497577
1272,"Hybrids are somewhat cursed here in the Philippines during the early levels, but people can only gape when they see a grown up hybrid in action... This is my pure observation but Hunters compromise 40% of the Philippine population, Knights around 25%, Priests at 15%and the rest goes to others. Main reason? Hunters are overpowered, overrated and have the largest assortment of elemental arrows to suit their needs. Their high agi makes them hard to hit, and their dexterity ensures they hit back. Their abused Blitz Beat skill makes it even unfair and the addition of traps can make MVP hunting somewhat forgivable. I know this is out of the topic but I felt damn right good about what I said. Hunter: Awww somebody beat me to Baphomet...not to worry that priest will be shredded to bits by the scythe later on...heheheheh. (Sees that the Baphomet misses the priest insanely) Hunter: Must be an agility type, but one hit will kill that show off (/gg) (The priest got hit, and the astounding amount reached to only 800!) Hunter: /omg Any other questions or comments just review, ok? I""ll still write this damn fic but it would help if I got a review or two! /heh Ja minna sai! Gotta get back to my Zoids fan fiction...Not to worry, I""ll still update this section of my life (but I""d rather play Ragnarok Online than do a fiction about it ) Argh! Sorry, and I mean, SORRY! For the very, very late update of this story. Gak! pRO kept me waiting and waiting for the Juno/Yuno Patch. Argh! Shove that silly patch off their unshaved arse! I decided to abandon the stupid waiting and decided to go on with life as it is. No more room for excuses. I decided to take matters in my own hands. So what if the silly patch doesn""t come? That doesn""t mean I can just lay off in my interest in writing, don""t I? So, after a millennia of waiting, and I quote ""You are so incompetent!"" by a special someone.... (sarcasm drooling over the place, you can cut the apathy with a blunt knife, plastic even...) I decided to go back in track and go on with the story. Shadow had beat me by already posting up his 16 chapters, which left me horrified if I do say so myself. Enough, on with the story... Chapter 10: Tigers and Snow always go together ""And the time would come.... when the mother of all snakes would devour the sacred soul of Yggdrassil; that Hel, Rune-Midgard, and Valhalla would come crashing down with the tree of reality. Odin would die and so would the gods... The twilight would begin for the immortal creatures as foreseen by the Norns. The twilight of the gods, that would be Ragnarok..."" The two found themselves inside a room in an inn, night fleeting outside the building. Only the candle gave enough light inside. ""Uhm, hey Byakko..."" The other snapped back at the sudden disturbance his brother did. Tiger grinned foolishly as he took his hand off the front of his brother""s face. ""Tiger...""Byakko whined. ""I was reading the book, okay?"" Byakko waved the grim book at him, his brother backing in fraudulent fear. ""Silly you...""Byakko managed to bring a whack at his brother with his free hand.",583064
862,"The boy managed to make it out to the section closest to him, the desert. Haymitch wasn""t looking forward to watching him dehydrate and die slowly. The boy died on day three. There had been a cobra with tracker jacker venom, it hadn""t been pretty to watch. Effie dug her face into Haymitch""s shirt for most of it and he sat confused as to why he was letting her. She began to cry, which Haymitch took as a cue to get a new drink. He filled two glasses, silently handing one to her. She accepted without a fight and begin to drink it almost immediately. Johanna Mason was still in the running. She hadn""t cried at all in the arena and was showing more skill than Haymitch had been expecting. Maybe Blight hadn""t been full of shit? ""Why do they keep dying, Haymitch?"" Effie lifted her head up to ask. Haymitch ignored her, but she kept asking, so he finally said, ""Because it""s what they""re supposed to do. They are supposed to die. It""s what the Capitol wants."" ""The Capitol doesn""t want dead children,"" Effie spat back. She finished her drink and got up to get a new one. Haymitch raised an eyebrow at the escort""s uncharacteristic outburst. The stylists still weren""t around, but Haymitch was still uncomfortable about where this was heading. When she had her new drink she plopped down much closer to the mentor than he liked. They sat and drank in silence for a while, until Effie started crying again. Haymitch reached for the remote, ""Maybe we should turn this off for a while."" Effie put her hand on his wrist. Her touch was warm and unexpected, and Haymitch almost dropped the damn remote. ""No,"" she said. ""I want to see the whole thing. I want to see who wins."" He returned to his drinking, getting up to fetch a bottle to place on the table before them to cut down on trips. She smiled at him, filling up her drink again. ""You know, this was supposed to be my year. The escort from two was going to step down and I was going to rise up. But no."" She took a long pull. Johanna Mason appeared on screen and Effie pointed at her with her glass. ""That bitch from 7 is going to take my spot. All because she got lucky and drew a winner at the right moment."" Effie glared at the tribute on the screen. ""Girl""s even pretty when she""s not crying."" Effie slammed down the empty glass and poured another. Haymitch grinned. He didn""t know Effie even had a side like this, but he quite liked it. He raised his glass for a toast and she obliged, clinking them together. She scooted closer to him, which Haymitch wasn""t so thrilled with. ""You know, I blame the stylists. I mean, why would you send them out naked? It threw them completely off. You could tell. Neither of the kids were all that bad to begin with but they were nervous wrecks after the parade. You could tell the trust was gone."" Haymitch said nothing. But Effie wormed her way into laying her head on his shoulder and looking up at him with bright blue eyes asked, ""Does the pain ever stop?"" She looked away. ""I don""t know if I can handle anymore dead children."" Unsure of what to do, Haymitch stayed still.",1497577
76,"Thinking harshly to him to pull up he quickly obeyed as he gave a few other sounds, almost as if he was chuckling at me. Rolling my eyes at the banshee below me I turned to find Tsu""tey pulling up beside us, as well as Atan""eko. Growling, Sage sensed my discomfort as he pulled back and waited for the others to pass. Then he flew up next to Jake""s ikran leaving a few curious Na""vi""s in his wake. A couple of heads turned to look at me, but when Tsu""tey noticed their eyes were no longer on the sky ahead he disciplined them harshly. With that they turned their eyes away as Tsu""tey""s now turned to look me. Our eyes locked for a brief moment, as they brought up memories of last night""s events. Then my eyes harden as a scowl spread throughout my lips. He hurt me. That""s all that mattered now. Turning to look forward I ignored his brief looks every once in awhile, or his harsh words to his other students when they did something wrong. I even ignored his irritated look with Jake and Neytiri as they began to flirt with one another openly by ramming their ikrans into one another. The only thing I kept my mind on was that soon this so called lesson would be over soon. When it was I continued flying without the others. A little closer to Home-tree, but all the same I continued to soar through the low hanging clouds. Being linked with Sage, just made me feel happy, calm, free even, and no matter what thought entered my mind the banshee always seemed to banish it with something better. Just like the human Sage had once done long ago when I was in one of my bad moods. ""I""ve missed you for so long, Sage,"" I whispered with closed eyes. Hearing a loud screech I opened my eyes and smiled brightly at the ikran below me. ""Is this really you returned from the other world, or just a trick,"" I asked with playfulness. However as I asked the question, it seemed as if it were answered with an image not from my mind, but from his; a vision of me twirling around in a white gown in one of the local bridal shops that had been in town. The same gown I had picked out for our wedding that never occurred. My eyes watered suddenly as I choked out a sob, ""It really is you isn""t?"" Sage flapped his wings fiercely while shaking his head. My tears continued to fall as I leaned against his back and held on tightly. ""Thank you Eywa. Thank you for sending him back to me,"" I whispered into the breeze. The wind whipped past me a lot quicker as if she really had heard me. Smiling I leaned back up and replied, ""Come on Sage, it""s time to go back to Home-Tree."" After leaving Sage to perch up high in the branches I made my way back down to entrance of Home-tree. Mainly to see if I could find Jake, however I found Atan""eko instead as he walked right up to me. It was as if he hadn""t done anything the way he looked at me and went to say, ""How are you today?"" I was so angered by it that without a single thought of hesitance I turned and landed my fist right into his nose. He stumbled backwards as all eyes turned on me.",806976
1506,"""I- I""m fine,"" she said again, between pants. ""No you""re not."" Percy said. A small smile speared on his face. ""Well, there""s only one thing to do now!"" ""Which is?"" ""I""ll carry you!"" He stated cheerfully. ""Percy, that""s a stupid idea. What if we run into monsters? You won""t be able to fight!"" Annabeth protested. But, since she was unable to come up with a better option (or so Percy assumed) she held her hand out and grudgingly got on his back. She wrapped her arms around his neck, getting ready for the piggy-back ride. ""You""ve got the backpack?"" Percy asked. She nodded. ""Here, hold Riptide, so we can see where we""re going,"" he said, and momentarily let go of her leg to pass her the sword. She held it carefully in front of them, trying her hardest to maintain hold on Percy one-handed. ""Just keep walking forward until we hit a wall. Then we can walk around that and try to find an exit,"" she suggested. ""Okay. Are you ready?"" Percy asked. She gulped and tightened her grip, both on Percy and the sword, but nodded again. They walked a few minutes in silence coming across nothing. More time passed. Still, they hadn""t even reached a wall. Finally, Annabeth cried, ""Look, Percy! There""s something up there!"" He hesitated for a second squinting into the darkness. There did appear to be something ahead of them. It was hard to say what, but it was definitely different from rock, the only thing they had encountered so far. Quickening his pace, they reached it in seconds. ""Is this... the wall?"" Percy asked, gently laying his hand against smooth metal. ""Of course!"" Annabeth cried, Percy could tell she was mentally slapping herself for not remembering whatever tidbit of information she was about to tell him. ""Tartarus is a dark pit surrounded by a wall of bronze!"" Percy stared her. ""Seriously? We just saved Nico from bronze jar, and now we""re trapped in one?"" ""Well, it""s much bigger than Nico""s was,"" she pointed out. ""Just so it can be stuffed to the brim with monsters and titans!"" ""True."" ""Is there anything else you can remember about this place that might possibly save our lives?"" he asked. ""Well besides the bronze it""s said to be surrounded a three-fold layer of night."" Percy stared at her. ""Who said that? Because you can tell them that it doesn""t make any sense."" ""It was in a poem written by Hesiod. He wrote a lot about Tartarus and the Underworld. He also said-"" suddenly her face turned pale. ""What? What is it?"" ""Percy,"" she started hesitantly. Do you remember how long we were falling?"" He frowned. ""What? I dunno... maybe an hour? It was hard to tell. Why?"" ""Because he also wrote that if you fall into Tartarus from Earth it takes nine days."" ""But that""s impossible! We weren""t falling for nine days!"" ""We might""ve been. Maybe something bent the time so it felt shorter to us, like in the Labyrinth."" ""You mean on the outside nine days might have already passed?"" ""I don""t know! I don""t know! Maybe Hesiod was wrong."" ""He was right about the bronze wall,"" Percy said darkly. ""Well, the only thing we can do now is reach the doors of death.""",2943978
2490,"""The quintessential man eater and her hapless prey."" ""Oh,"" Nanako said, and turned around to set the tray down where the dishwasher could easily collect it. Surprisingly, she didn""t add anything else. Meiko looked at her senpai, wondering if she was missing something. ""Spit it out,"" she said after a long moment, deciding a direct approach was best. ""It""s nothing, hon,"" Nanako demurred. ""Don""t you have an order to get to the chef?"" Meiko gasped slightly, a hand reflexively covering her mouth. ""I almost forgot!"" she exclaimed in horror, the lack of attention to her work flustering her tremendously. The chef cheerfully agreed to match the bottle of red zinfandel the bartender had provided. He liked couples that let him experiment with the menu, because the bistro attracted far too few adventurous types for his liking. Most diners preferred to stick with ""tried and true"" meals. She returned a couple minutes later, ready to serve the wine, and hoping that her tardiness hadn""t been noticed. She showed both of them the label, and the woman nodded with approval. ""That should be fine,"" she said, smiling as she stroked the hand of her dinner companion. Meiko cut the casing and removed the cork, pouring out a couple tablespoons worth of the valuable liquor (which retailed for around 40,000 yen a bottle). The woman took it from her gracefully, holding the glass up to the light to inspect the color as she swirled it to check the wine""s legs. A smile curved her (red, red) lips as she held it under her nose to smell the bouquet. Then she took a sip, letting the wine linger on her tongue before swallowing. ""Very good,"" she said, before indicating Meiko should finish pouring the wine. Meiko finished pouring, unable to avoid noticing the smooth elegance of the woman as she raised her glass again. After setting the bottle on the table, she went to fetch the hors d""oeuvres. Chef had outdone himself, she thought as she saw the lobster bisque he had whipped up, served in tiny demitasse cups with spoons garnished with dollops of crème fraîche. It was a bit unconventional, but this couple seemed the type to appreciate it (or the woman would, and anyone looking at the two could tell who had control in that relationship). She made her way back through the restaurant, noticing how the woman was actually leaning against the man""s arm. His eyes were fastened on his date""s face, which made Meiko pause for a bit. With the outfit the woman was wearing, most men would be focused on her chest. Especially considering the casual contact the woman kept indulging in. It was a slight note of discord to the image of ""vamp and victim"" Meiko had mentally formed of the couple. The woman smiled and thanked her as she set the food down, before picking up the spoon and taking a small bite of the spicy bisque. ""This is wonderful,"" she said, a blissful smile on her face. ""Please pass my compliments to the chef."" Despite her expectations, the couple proved to be remarkably easy to serve.",1112924
3332,"I don""t mind..."" then she grabbed a chair and plunked herself down, ""I knocked him out after all....Besides, don""t you need to keep an eye on his brother?...Alphonse, was it?"" ""Yes...I suppose I should,"" she said. Noah turned, and went to the door. The, Winry called out. ""Oh, Noah!....What""s his name?"" ""Who""s?"" ""His,"" Winry said, looking at the young man on the bed. Noah blinked her dark eyes, then she said, ""Edward...His name is Edward..."" then she walked out of the room. When they were left alone, Winry looked down at the young man again. She just looked at him for a minute. Then she reached out, and brushed some of his hair back out of his face...used her thumb to wipe off a crum of bread on his cheek, then she raised her thumb up to her mouth. ""....Edward...."" When Ed woke up, his eyes were closed, he knew they were, but there was a terribly bright flashing light, and his head was killing him. He grunted, then raised his right arm to where it was throbbing most, and touched a big knot. ""OW!"" he cried. ""D it!"" ""Don""t cuss,"" said Winry""s voice. Ed opened his eyes, and squinted. The room was dim, the setting sun sending its last rays in through the windows. He looked to his left, and saw Winry sitting beside him. On a table by the bed was a bowl with water, and a rag hanging off the side. ""We""re in a church, after all,"" Winry said. ""Huh...? Oh...right,"" Ed said, sitting up and leaning on the metal headboard of the bed he was on. He looked around. The room had a few identical beds along the walls. He looked at Winry again, and she smiled at him, though her eyes looked apologetic. ""I""m sorry I hit you,"" she said. ""I don""t know why I did it, I just...Paniced."" Ed thought a second, then smiled and laughed. ""Its alright...Its happened before, but, not for a while. I guess I""m not used to it anymore,"" he said, then he rubbed his face. ""How long was I out?"" ""About four hours,"" Winry said as she reached for the wash rag, and rung it out, ""Here....We don""t have ice, but this might help the swelling."" Ed looked at the rag, then gently pushed her hand away, ""Neh, I""m fine...Really."" Winry blinked at him for a minute, then she put the rag back in the bowl. As she set her hand in her lap, she asked, ""Why is your arm metal?"" Ed stood up straight, and blinked back at her, ""Huh?....Oh!....My Arm,"" he said, then he looked at it, and took his glove off, ""You like it?"" he asked. He then rolled up his sleeve, and showed her more of it. ""It""s called ""auto mail""...it""s a sort of mechanical prosthetic...I lost my right arm and left leg about ten years ago in..."" he stopped. He""d almost said how he really lost it. Transmuting base material to bring his and Al""s mother back. He lowered his arm, then said, ""In an accident..."" He looked at Winry. The look on her face said she knew he was lying, but he couldn""t tell anyone here he was from another world. He looked down, and said, ""Wanna see my leg? They were made by the best,"" he was reaching down, when Winry stood up. ""No,"" she said, reaching for the bowl.",512464
2661,"His were closed but they peaked open at her movement. ""What was that?"" she asked. Laxus closed his eyes again. ""Do we have to have the conversation right now?"" ""Yes."" He ignored her response, ""Because I was thinking we could take advantage of one of the beds on the second floor in a few minutes."" ""A few minutes?"" Laxus"" eyes peeked open again, ""I""m only human, demon. I""ve need a recovery period like any other man."" Mira laughed lightly, putting her head back on his chest, ""The Thunder Legion would be so disappointed to discover you""re not a god after all."" Laxus glared at the white hair covering his chest. Mira said, ""So is this just a one-time thing?"" Laxus thought for a moment before answering, ""I don""t think I want this to be a one-time thing."" Mira bit her lip before responding. ""I don""t want to have a relationship with a guild mate. Everyone around here is so nosy, and I don""t want them involving themselves in my romantic life."" Laxus suppressed a chuckle at the queen of nosy meddling calling out the other members. ""Whatever you want."" Mira popped up again, smiling at him, ""Then I""ll race you to the second floor."" She ran off to the staircase. Laxus grinned back, dashing after her, determined to catch her. It was simple in the beginning, a friends with benefits arrangement that suited them both. He""d go on jobs, she""d flirt and date while he was away, and when he came back, they would always find time to be alone together. It worked well for them. No commitments and a lot of fun. But then Mira noticed little things that began annoying her. Like when Laxus"" eyes strayed to Cana""s or Lucy""s boobs. Or when a group of fangirls followed him to the bar and fawned over him. But most of all, she was annoyed at herself, as she was starting to miss him when he went away on long trips and wanted to ask him if he""d been with anyone else while on the road. Which was not the arrangement they""d agreed on when they started this thing. At her insistence, they were keeping it light and just having some fun. It came to a head when a few Blue Pegasus mages visited Fairy Tail. They had finished a job nearby and dropped in to say hi to friends and have a drink. Mira was surprised that the men had mostly refrained from hitting all of the Fairy Tail women, and Jenny Realight wasn""t constantly posing and fighting with her. In fact they were mostly staying at the table with the Thunder Legion and Laxus. Though Mira supposed that shouldn""t surprise her, the group had joined Blue Pegasus when Fairy Tail had disbanded. It made sense that they""d made friends at the other guild. Mira remembered being surprised when she found out that Laxus and his crew had joined that guild, as she (and most people) thought of it as the pretty boy guild. And while she had always found Laxus attractive, she had never thought of him as a pretty boy. Still, the table seemed to be getting along well. Telling stories and laughing like old friends. Mira wasn""t happy to see Jenny seated next to Laxus, but she pushed her jealousy down. It didn""t mean anything.",1497577
2858,"It was a matter of pride among the senior lawyers that no advertising was necessary (god forbid they sink to the level of ambulance chasers and the like). Mustang""s priorities rarely lined up with the rest of the partners, however, not that he was about to tell them that. He leaned back in his chair (the paperwork in front of him forgotten) and wondered about the details of the case. He reached for the paper bag from the coffee shop. Just as he was pulling out the blueberry muffin, his phone rang. ""Hello?"" he asked, taking a bite of the muffin. ""Sir, it""s Hawkeye,"" came the reply. ""Great, great,"" he said, mouth full of muffin. There was a static-y sigh from the other end. ""I think you need to come down here, sir."" ""Why?"" Mustang asked, leaning forward, elbows pressed against his desk. ""There""s a case you want to take."" A/N And that""s the first chapter. More of a prologue really but whatever. Please review/favorite/follow! I""ve got the next chapter and I""ll probably post in in a few days, but I""d really love to hear feedback on this one! Other notes: I am not a lawyer or otherwise involved with the American legal system, but rather a 17 year-old high school student so if any information in this chapter or future ones is wrong, I apologize. Also, despite the fact that Archer is a character, this is definitely more of a Brotherhood fanfic than original series. He just seemed like the best character to fit the archetype I was looking for. Anyway, that""s it! I hope you enjoyed it, and stay tuned for future postings! A/N Thank you guys so much for all the reviews/follows/favorites on the last chapter, despite the fact that nothing actually happened. This chapter is pretty much the scene that I built this entire AU around in my head, so hopefully it turned out okay. And, as mentioned in the previous author""s note, I am not a lawyer and have only a high school understanding of the legal system. That being said, I did do some research, but I had trouble finding the exact information I needed and got bored rather quickly and ended up deciding to kind of fudge the things I wasn""t sure about. I sincerely apologize for all mistakes. The same goes for the geography of New York City. Anyway, please enjoy and don""t forget to review! ""So what""s so important about this case, Hawkeye?"" Mustang asked, meeting his number one outside the police station. He was carrying the chai latte he had bought earlier (now completely cold) and handed it to the woman in front of him. Hawkeye took a sip of the tea, and, if the coldness bothered her, she didn""t let it show. ""You want it, trust me,"" she said quickly. Too quickly. Mustang narrowed his eyes. ""And the details?"" he asked, holding the door open for her as they both entered the building. She sighed. ""It""s not great, sir."" She hesitated a moment, tongue pressed to the roof of her mouth. ""A fifteen-year-old kid shot his mother."" Mustang took a step back and let the door swing shut. ""What?"" ""At least that""s what the police say."" ""Oh, that""s what the police say."" Mustang ran a hand along the edge of his mouth.",2943978
1910,"Ulrich casually stroked it a few times, considering what to do next. His original plan had been to tie William up, with decorative knots and rope-play, before his plans changed to breaking in his new whip. Yet, judging by the time on his watch, he had just spent an inordinately long amount of time on it and Yumi was due to meet them soon. This was not how he wanted Yumi to see William. He looked around the scene then down at his cock and an idea struck him. Ulrich dug around his bag until he pulled out a padded leather blindfold and looked back at his submissive. ""Ulrich,"" William said softly. Ulrich looked up in surprise. He hadn""t commanded William to do that. William hadn""t made any other moves, but Ulrich had made up his mind. ""Are you ready for showtime, my sweet William?"" Ulrich had told Jeremie about his meeting with Yumi earlier in the week. ""I can""t tell her what it is I..."" Ulrich hesitated, searching for the right words. ""Me and William... she needs to understand. She deserves to know the truth. I""m going to show her the truth."" Jeremie had argued against it, but in the end, Ulrich""s reasoning won. ""I care about her too much and she won""t understand if she doesn""t see for herself..."" Ulrich had shaken his head. ""She won""t believe me."" ""She might not understand,"" Jeremie warned. ""She might not speak to you again. What happens then? What happens to us? The Lyoko Warriors?"" Ulrich shrugged. ""We have our duties to defeat X.A.N.A. but we can""t let him stop us from living our lives. Whether this happens now or later... it""ll hurt more if I keep dragging her along. These feelings. The truth."" ""Why are you telling me?"" Jeremie had asked. ""I""m not the best person when it comes to helping others with their emotional problems. Why not Aelita or..."" Jeremie had almost said Odd then, but quickly stopped short. Because the notion of Odd being sensitive and caring was ridiculous. They were not exactly Odd""s forte. Or in Odd""s vocabulary. ""It has to be you,"" Ulrich said, looking Jeremie in the eyes. ""You may not have realized it but Yumi, she-"" When Ulrich didn""t continue, Jeremie had prodded his friend. ""Yumi what?"" Ulrich had shaken his head. ""Nothing. You""ll see; you both will."" He had been told the time and place. ""She""ll definitely be there,"" Ulrich told him. ""It""s one of Yumi""s favorite places to go when she""s upset or troubled."" Jeremie had briefly thought of following her to her meeting with Ulrich, but whatever Ulrich had planned, it was for her eyes only. ""And William?"" Jeremie asked Ulrich. Ulrich had given Jeremie a lopsided smile. ""He won""t be present either. It""ll be just me and Yumi."" ""Have you ever made him suppress his memory before?"" Jeremie inquired. With that, Ulrich laughed heartily. ""You think I would spring this on William and expect him to be okay with it? Even he has limits, you know."" ""And if you""re wrong? What if she isn""t there?"" Jeremie said, changing to subject. ""She will be,"" Ulrich said. ""How do you know?"" After a beat of silence, Ulrich spoke up. ""Because it""s the place we first met.""",583994
2644,"explaining what happened during that regeneration, we all fall silent. I""m still standing beside Jack, but now the Doctor is looking straight at me, only me, and the shine is back in his eyes. I step forward, almost shy now. Jack""s arms slides away from my shoulders, and I can feel him step back, turning to Donna, giving me and the Doctor the moment we both so desperately waited for. My whole body is shaking when I finally reach him, and for a split second, I hesitate, but then he makes a move, and so do I, and then I""m lying in his arms. My heart is racing against his two, and I wrap my arms around him as if I never want to let him go again, and the truth is that I really don""t. My head is buried in his shoulder, taking in that familiar scent of him, his messy hair brushing the side of my cheek. He hugs me back with all he has, enfolding me completely in his arms, and somehow I know that he""s thinking exactly the same. I don""t know how long we were standing there, it felt like too long and too short at the same time. How can you make up for two years of separation in just one embrace? All those lost moments, those unsaid words that won""t come to us even now? We""re both speechless and silent, completely absorbed by the mere fact of seeing each other again. Eventually, someone taps on my back, lightly at first, then harder. Reluctantly, very reluctantly, I loosen my grip on the Doctor and lift my head from his shoulder. We look into each other""s eyes once again, both beaming now. Then I turn my head to see Jack standing behind me. ""If you don""t mind, we still have some work to do,"" he says, pointing his head to the monitors showing that Dalek invasion. Then he winks at me. ""And besides, Rose Tyler, I wouldn""t mind giving you a huge hug, too."" In the TARDIS - After the Battle We made it. We saved it all - the world, the universe, our families, us. Everything that matters. And the Daleks are gone, once and for all. Our joyous celebration of our victory lasts a while. Everyone wants to hug everyone, and so they do, and that takes a while. In all the commotion, I""m barely able to exchange a couple of words with Sarah Jane, Donna and Martha. I""d like to get to know them better, especially Martha, whom I haven""t met before. We""re the Children of Time, the Doctor""s (or would that now be the Doctors""?) most faithful companions. But no one""s really in the condition to talk; all that comes out is joyous, senseless jabbering. I find myself being bear-hugged by Mickey; a smacking kiss is placed on the top of my head by Jack; Martha gives me a warm hug that makes me regret the jealousy I felt about her earlier; Sarah Jane squeezes my hand; Donna sweeps down on me and almost knocks me over; and finally, two identical arms slide around my shoulders from the left and from the right, and I find myself standing right between the two identical Doctors. It""s strange, having two Doctors around. I thought I knew my Doctor better than anyone else, but even I can only tell them apart by the different clothes they""re wearing.",240213
1564,"Not plant a seed and wait for it overnight to grow into the foundation of a house, and summon the earth to make the walls. Sora still stared, ogling at the newly constructed house just by the corner. It was rather strange too, since they had a lot of foreigners before; but Sora was the only one couldn""t understand more than one person. Sora insisted he spoke perfect Japanese. Roxas countered everyone he talked to spoke perfect Japanese to him; but everyone he spoke to said his Nuem was perfect. Sora asked him how that was possible. ""It""s that."" Roxas spoke the word as if it were the explanation to everything. He had taken him in their family""s sweet shop. It was a nice little dink, right smack in the center of the village, facing the town""s monument (a single golden wing that was outstretched). Sora had thought it looked almost normal... The shop looked ordinary. Tables and chairs here and there. A banner outside with the shop""s name (""The Keyhole""), and sliding doors that allowed good ventilation for when the shop was too hot. The glass counter outside was empty of the treats it would have displayed on normal days. ""It""s a rest day for everyone. We start work tomorrow in here."" He answered, as if knowing that curious look Sora had for the emptiness. Sora carefully inched across the area, poking tables and chairs one by one. He was rather careful now. He didn""t want the next thing he sat on to blurt out that it didn""t want his ass on their faces. (The rock near the road had courteously pointed that out to him). ""What are you doing?"" Roxas peeked from upstairs, curious why the brunet did not follow him. He narrowed his eyes when he noticed the brunet poking around. ""Hurry up here. I want you to meet my grandma."" ""I""m coming."" Sora made for the stairs, following the blond to the second floor. Roxas was already by the door on the far end of the corridor. ""Grandpa is inside."" He whispered, like afraid to wake the dead. ""He""s physically blind, but he""ll still see you. You""ll know what I mean when you meet him."" ""Oh I know."" Sora rolled his eyes. ""It""s that, isn""t it?"" Roxas smirked, grinning wider. ""Well, you""re not such a bad egg after all."" The blond carefully slid the door open, revealing a rather disconcerting sight. There were spears everywhere, in every wall and corner of the room. A single beam of sunlight pierced through the darkness of the room, it""s rays falling at the feet of the person who was sitting in a rocking chair at the center of the dark room. ""Wait...ARE THOSE MUSHROOMS?!"" Sora harshly whispered, pointing at patches of mushrooms that grew in a circle around the figure in the center. Roxas turned around, still relaxed. ""Don""t you have mushrooms where you come from?"" ""We do."" Sora scratched his head. ""But they don""t necessarily grow right smack near people""s feet."" ""Roxas?"" The boy fully slid the door open. ""I""m here grandpa."" Roxas answered curtly at the voice. That sure did not sound like someone who was supposedly in his ""old age.'",583064
2669,"""W-what?"" ""Instead, Kiku is declaring another war with us."" Arthur finished. Yao let out a heavy sigh ""Aru~"" while Alfred looked away. ""Damn him. Then, we will fire little boy and fat man. Tomorrow, we fire little boy. If he will not surrender, we go with fat man."" He said with a more serious tone. The Brit sighed and smiled. ""Sure thing. I""ll call Australia and MacArthur."" The next day, Alfred""s first troop of soldiers prepared themselves. Their main plan was drop the first atomic bomb at Hiroshima. Moments later, they passed by Hiroshima and dropped the first atomic bomb in history. As expected, a loud explosion was heard. Hurriedly, Alfred called Kiku while looking at the destroyed city. ""Surrendering now?"" He dared. In the other line, Kiku was about to say ""yes"" and was shuddering in fear but a voice in Japanese yelled something at the poor nation in which Alfred couldn""t understand. The man sounded angry. Not a moment passed, Kiku answered his reply. ""N-not yet, Amerika-san."" The Japanese said with fear and uncertainness. Alfred crossed his eyebrows. ""Tch. Damn it. You just better or I""ll-"" Before he could ever finish, Kiku hanged up. He faced his troops. ""Yo guys! Japan had not surrendered yet. Please inform Arthur and Mac."" The soldiers agreed unto this. LATER~ ""Maaaaaaaaac! Artiiiiiiiiiiiiiiie! Aussiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiie! What""ll we do?"" Alfred whined while the three persons he mentioned looked at him. ""Fire the second bomb, right?"" Arthur reminded him with a hint of sarcasm. ""I know! But what if he does not surrender again?"" The three glared. ""Make another one, idiot!"" The three of them yelled in unison Alfred laughed nervously. ""Chill guys!"" He told the three glaring at him. ""We""ll give them two days."" MacArthur told Alfred who agreed with this. DAYS PASSED LOL~ ""He hasn""t surrendered yet!"" The American yelled at the Brit. Hurriedly, Arthur smacked him hard with a book he was reading. This caused Alfred to land flat on the ground. ""That hurts a lot, you know! You nearly destroyed my head!"" He said, trying to get up. Arthur glared back. ""So did my eardrums."" He replied with more anger showing. Returning to the plot, Arthur smacked his brother again. ""Ow! What was that for?"" Alfred said, while aiding his head. ""Attack Japan using the last atomic bomb you bloody git! Was that not your plan?"" He answered back, trying not to laugh while looking at the poor nation, massaging his head. Back on his serious mode, Alfred proudly said, ""Tomorrow, we drop fat man at Nagasaku!"" ""It""s ""Nagasaki"", Alfred."" Arthur corrected. ""Alright dude. Whatever."" *DRUMROLLS* THE DAY! NEXT DAY! ~ Alfred was looking down at Nagasaki, onboard his plane. ""Guys! We can drop it here!"" He signalled his troops. They dropped the hazardous bomb at Nagasaki now. Then a loud explosion was heard. Alfred shielded his eyes the moment he heard it. He called Kiku again, five minutes after the dropping of fat man. ""So what now?"" Kiku was still uncertain but on the other line, he""s facial expression was filled with anger, pain, worried, trauma and fright.",2750536
2860,"The prosecution was going to have field day. Yep, he already knew he was going to regret taking this case. ""Where is he?"" he asked. ""In interrogation room 3 with Buccaneer. I watched some through the glass, but they wouldn""t let me in. I talked to his brother who""s sitting with Neil. Nice kid, insists his brother is innocent, which seems hopeful."" ""Well I guess it""s time to meet my client."" With that, Mustang marched confidently towards the interrogation rooms, Hawkeye following closely behind. As he approached them, he caught sight of a kid, maybe twelve or thirteen, with dark-blond hair and big gold eyes sitting haplessly on a bench. He slowed, and nodded to the kid as they passed. ""The brother?"" He whispered to Hawkeye. She nodded in confirmation. ""Alphonse, fourteen years old."" ""Does he have anywhere to go?"" Mustang asked, feeling a pang for the kid despite himself. He couldn""t help it, the boy just looked so pathetic and confused huddled on the bench, eyes downcast. And no wonder, his mother was dead and the police were saying his brother did it. ""I don""t know, sir."" ""Find out. If we""re taking this case we""re doing it right."" Hawkeye nodded and peeled off to go and speak to Alphonse. Mustang continued a few more feet, stopping when he reached the third interrogation room. He paused a moment, taking in a deep breath and collecting his thoughts before he pushed open the door. The scene that greeted him was more less what he was expecting. The lights were low and a shiny metal desk sat between two people. On one side Detective Buccaneer, a huge man with his head shaved on both sides with a long black braid running down the center, was leaning over the table. He was wearing a collared shirt rolled up at the elbows and his tie was hanging loosely around his neck. An NYPD jacket hung on the chair behind him. It was clear they had been there for a while. Across from the Detective sat a fairly scrawny teenager (Mustang couldn""t tell from where he was standing, but he would wager the kid was pretty short as well), with shoulder length blond hair. He was leaned back in his seat (as far as was possible with his hands cuffed to the table) and was glaring at Buccaneer. Both turned when Mustang entered. ""What the hell do you think you""re doing?"" Buccaneer asked as the door swung shut behind him. ""I think the real question is the what the hell are you doing?"" Mustang responded confidently, moving to stand behind the kid, and staring the large Detective in the eye. ""This is a murder investigation!"" Buccaneer thundered angrily. ""I don""t care who you think you are, Mustang, but you can""t come barging in here like-"" ""I""m Mr. Elric""s legal counsel."" ""Who the hell are you?"" the kid asked, turning in his chair to look Mustang over contemptuously. ""I didn""t hire any lawyer."" Buccaneer ignored his suspect and continued glaring at Mustang. ""There is no way the PD""s office sent you over."" A mocking smile spread across Mustang""s mouth. ""Wonderful observation! It""s good to know that some detective work gets done around here."" Buccaneer""s eyes narrowed.",2943978
430,"(Later at night, at the Tendo Training hall) Soun Tendo is at his desk filling out some paperwork, Then Girlman appears from the shadows and Soun then says, ""GIRLMAN! So we finally meet, I see I finally met someone who shares the deep commitment of ridding the dark and corrupting city of crime."" Girlman then says, ""Oh and congradulations on being promoted to Comissioner, now what is the clue you wanted me to see?"" Soun then gives Girlman a tiny flashlight that emits a infra-red signal and Soun says, ""Apparently, the criminals you apprehanded have these and they seem to call on someone they call ""The Killer Moth"", he has the same M.O. as you but the opposite, instead of fighting for justice, he fights for injustice. See to it that you can get to the bottom of... huh?"" Soun notices that Girlman vanished into the night...

Ranma then says, ""Hi Tsubasa, I see you""re taking a break from your D.A. duties for the school play but why is your costume a coin?"" Tsubasa then says ""Well it is fitting that I""m dressed as a TWO-FACEd coin, and I""m the junior D.A. of Gotham ward. Also there will be a costume party at the new okonomiyaki restaurant tonight. I can""t wait! So who""s the lady Ranma?"" Ranma then says, ""This is Akane Tendo, Comissioner Tendo""s daughter and friend of the family, her sister also helps the family.""

The two then blush and stumble but then suddenly, they see a teenaged ""boy"" of Ranma""s age and ""he""starts attacking him with a giant spatula. Ranma kept dodging the attacks and then when he gets a good look at the attacker, he then says, ""Uuchan-is that you?"" The attacker then says, ""Yes Ran-chan, it""s me! Ukyo Kuonji! And now to pay you back for the decade of shame!"" So Ukyo throws mini-spatulas at Ranma but dodges it and then they kept fighting until they both got tired and then Ukyo then says, ""After I get through with you, I will find your father and make him pay!"" Ranma then says, ""It doesn""t matter, a criminal killed him many when I was 8..."" Akane then says, ""Ok, you two... explain everything to me! This isn""t exactly making any sense!"" (Ranma and Ukyo""s flashback begins) 6 year old Ranma was vacationing at Osaka with the family but then he sees Ukyo for the first time and then on a daily basis they played a game in which they play fight and when Ranma wins he gets a free okonomiyaki from Ukyo""s father who just so happens to be a Okonomiyaki vender. Eventually, Ukyo""s father suggested to Genma that the two should be engaged and throw in his okonomiyaki car t in as a dowry (Ranma had no idea Ukyo is a female the whole time) Genma agreed but he remembered the promise he made to Soun but found himself unwilling to give up the okonomiyaki cart, Genma came up with the perfect idea, he goes up to Ranma and asks, ""Ok boy, what do you like more? Ukyo or okonomiyaki?""",910821
1064,"I fought with them, against my own brothers and sisters! I offered my self, my mountain as a prison for their most fearsome enemy, Typhoeus, and that was no day at the park.

Not a thank you, not a well done, just those two idiots,"" she said, gesturing towards the two men now standing at attention. Now Jason was really confused. ""And when they shifted to the West, did they take me? No they just left me here to rot!"" ""That was mostly your fault, mother,"" one of the two men said. ""Silence!"" Aitna fell back down on her throne, and raised a hand to massage her forehead. ""Oh mother Gaea, what did I do to deserve such insolent sons?"" ""Trusted the gods,"" the other one said. Aitna seemed to want to reply, but decided against it. She turned to look at Leo and Jason again. ""Allow me to introduce my sons. The Palikoi."" ""Palikoi..."" Jason muttered to himself. The names didn""t sound familiar, so they were probably very minor gods. ""They are my sons by either Jupiter or Vulcan."" ""Or?"" Leo asked incredulously. ""How do you not know?"" Aitna stood up angrily. This time Jason was sure she wobbled. She had to put her hand on the back of her throne to regain her balance. ""It was after the titans were defeated! We celebrated for many days, feasted and drank wine. My memories of it are... hazy"" ""Oh..."" Leo looked extremely uncomfortable. Jason didn""t blame him. ""So how do you know it was... one of our dads?"" ""I""m certain it was one of them,"" Aitna said shortly, thankfully not answering Leo""s question. ""I informed them of the fact and neither bothered to even stop by to see me!"" ""So, you""re going to imprison and kill us, because our fathers didn""t call you back after a one night stand?"" Jason asked. ""More or less,"" one of the two men muttered. ""You will not speak!"" Aitna yelled at him. ""Do you see what the gods have done to me? I used to be the most powerful mountain goddess there was, and now look at me!"" she said, and for the first time Jason noticed the lines on her face. ""When it was time to shift, I gave Jupiter and Vulcan an ultimatum, but they ignored it! Instead they moved Tphoeus to some new mountain, younger than me! I lost everything! Thankfully my mother is a forgiving person. She has pardoned my behavior in the first war, and has given the chance to exact my revenge."" Leo still looked confused. ""But aren""t gods having kids all the time? What""s so important about those two?"" ""They are my only children, I fear forever. And thanks to their father, they are also complete idiots."" Jason looked at the men, who he now realized were either his or Leo""s half brothers. He suddenly felt sorry for them, having to put up with a screechy goddess all day. He didn""t want to kill the. (And if they were indeed gods, it would be hard to do so, given their immortality.) ""Are you going to let her talk to you like that?"" he asked. The men blinked. ""She is our mother,"" one of them said. ""So?"" Leo asked, realizing what Jason was doing.",2943978
2014,"Said looked through the crowd of prisoners, so many different faces.... so many different colors; god why hadn""t he seen all the different colored faces? Kareem Said saw white, black, yellow, and various other colors and all he could think about was when he stabbed Shillenger the black and the white mixed with the dark red of the blood. He had plenty of time to think about a lot of things while he was in the hole and all he could think about was Tobias Beecher, what was it about Tobias Beecher that made him re-think every little thing he did ever since the minute he walked in OZ? Said had been happy where he was, he was leader of the muslims, he was in a very high place--- but then Tobias Beecher walked in the room and started asking questions, saying how he wanted God to love him and Said felt his heart reach out to him and then everything changed. Said had stabbed Shillenger for Beecher, he had seen what that Nazi fuck was going to do and before he knew what he was doing, he had stabbed Shillenger and the scariest thing was--- it was that he was glad he stabbed Shillenger. Beecher opened Said""s eyes open to something bigger then the muslims, bigger then OZ, bigger then Allah... Beecher made Said see the harsh reality that life sucks, there are no miracles and there is no paradise you go to after you die, all you got is what you got when you""re alive, you got memories, you got your friends--- but that""s all, there is no life after death--- once you die, you die... no light, no angels, no nothing... it""s just death. Kareem Said would be lying if he said, that he hadn""t grown some sort of an attachment to Tobias Beecher--- he had told himself that Beecher was just this person he was saving, but Beecher was something more, Beecher was this source, he didn""t know what kind of source Beecher was, but he knew that Beecher was some sort of source for him.... ""Said?"" Said whirled around, tearing himself away from his thoughts, the same thoughts that threatened to suck him in some sort of black hole and never release him, Said looked up to see Beecher staring at him with a tired expression on his face but nevertheless, he had a smile on his face. ""Beecher"" The two men stared at each other for a second, just a few inches away from each other, they took in the moment and then as if on cue they hugged each other. ""I have been so worried about you"" Beecher had blurted out the sentence, as if he had been rehearsing it since the minute Said was taken to the hole. Said tilted his head and smile but his smile faded when he saw the faint scar on Beecher""s throat--- where Robson had cut him. ""It left a scar"" Beecher nodded and turned his head. ""He""s back"" Said followed Beecher""s gaze and saw Keller lying in the hospital bed, staring at them cautiously, trying to pretend that he wasn""t--- Christopher Keller was never really the one to hide what he was doing. ""When did that happen?"" Beecher grabbed a chair and pushed one towards Said, Said looked around and just realized he was in the hospital ward--- when had he got here?",29783
3582,"""You know that I will be there to help you until the day one of us is dead."" ""What you saw was monstrous, Abel,"" Caterina continued, ""That such things actually happen is proof that devils walk among us even if you do not believe in god."" She spoke, and as she spoke she was at her most vulnerable, ""Abel,"" she spoke barely above a whisper, a single tear fell down her cheek, ""Let us help you Abel, please; I cannot imagine what you are going through but please, just let me help. Don""t do this to yourself."" Abel stared up into Caterina""s face, his finger rubbing finally stopped. Immediately, Abel felt heat rise to his face and an uncomfortable sweat came over him. At last he could help it no longer; Abel lunged forward and hugged Caterina like she was going to vanish before his eyes. She would die, they would all die; Esther, Caterina, the Professor. Even Tres Inques the android would fall to pieces and rust before Abel would die. Immortality was a curse; it was also the ultimate form of revenge. Abel went through life, everything he saw dying before his eyes like mayflies. Though he loved fiercely, the burn of loss never listened. To others though, like his twisted late brother; immortality was the ideal form of revenge. Cane never cared about the changing world, for he had no earthly attachment to anyone or thing. It gave him pleasure to know that the humans he tortured would die, their children would die, his grandchildren would die and their great grandchildren would die but he""d always be there to turn their laughter into squeals of pain. Abel was a drug addict and violence was his drug; he couldn""t stop being an addict. All he could do was stop being violent, become the happy, luckless clown who took ridiculous amounts of sugar in his tea. He really, honestly wished that he could be that person but he wasn""t. Abel stood in the shower, lathering and rinsing himself. The hot water helped calm him down and the act of cleaning his body made him feel as if his crimes were falling away. As the scalding water fell on him, Abel knew that he was at a crossroads. He did not want to be a violent man, despite his promise to defend humanity; yet how could he not resort to violence when animals like Bradley were on the loose. Before the crusnik there was nothing but pain and uncertainty. Yet for all his depression, Abel felt a small bit of hope; the choice really was his. The problem was confessed, he could stop it. Twelve steps and all that entailed; if you believed that crap. It was true for terrans and methuselah, no growth could come without some kind of pain and uncertainty and for the first time in a while, Abel felt like there was really something he could grow into. Abel was interrupted from his musings by the sound of the bathroom door opening. The sudden influx of cold air made the crusnik slightly uncomfortable. ""Who""s there?"" Abel asked hesitantly. ""Is it Sister Sofia?"" he asked, after the name of the new nun. ""Is that you Caterina?"" The intruder made no verbal answer. ""I""m warning you, I""m naked.""",1220273
3697,"Chapter 1.....The Heartbreak It seemed as if they had been traveling for an eternity. Tohru had spent the last few weeks in a daze. She""d tried to be friendly to the other kids while they were on the ship, but it hadn""t always worked out. Many of them took advantage of her naturally kind nature and many of them picked on her. ""She hasn""t got anyone that wants her,"" a boy had whispered behind her back, ""the Sohmas are probably only adopting her as a tax-write-off."" ""She""s so plain and so air-headed,"" a girl had said, ""she""ll believe anything you tell her."" They had done a number of other things that were hurtful, as well. They often tried to steal Tohru""s picture of her mother and hide it just to upset her. Other times, they would pointedly exclude her from their games. To break the monotony of being on the boat, they would pick one game to play all day and then the next day pick a different game. One day, they were playing Fruits Basket. ""I""m an orange!"" one would say. ""I""m a peach!"" Another would cry. ""What can I be?"" Tohru had asked. ""You can be the rice ball,"" the girl had said smugly. Tohru clapped her hands together, ecstatic that somebody was actually including her. But as time went on and all the others were called, she never once heard anyone say ""rice ball."" As a consequence, it became her unwanted nickname. Now, at last, they were getting off the boat. The other kids chanted ""Rice Ball!"" as she walked past, but she only smiled sadly. At least there was her new family to look forward to... ""Number Forty-Three! Tohru Honda!"" the man said over the loudspeaker. She""d been watching as the children were called one by one (unless there were siblings) to the front of the line where their relatives greeted them. The earthquake had claimed many more lives than just Kyoko Honda""s. Tohru bravely marched to the front of the line carrying her suitcases. She looked around for warm smiles and hugs, but there came none, only an awkward silence. She felt the blood drain from her face and her stomach turn. ""Number forty-three! TOHRU HONDA!"" the man enunciated firmly as if speaking to someone hard of hearing. Surely they would come now... The crowd of children burst into laughter. ""Rice ball! Rice ball!"" they chanted. ""Just step aside, dear. I""m sure someone will come for you soon. Perhaps they""re only running late."" Tohru""s head hung as a tear trickled down her cheek. Or maybe they didn""t want me... Despite her usual sunny outlook on things, she couldn""t help but think the worst had happened. The sky was gray and murky and a storm was brewing. Perhaps the letter from this ""Hatori Sohma"" was a cruel prank that someone was playing on her. Perhaps they had changed their mind and didn""t want a ten-year-old-girl hanging around. She looked down at the generic black dress that they""d put her in. Despite doing her best with her appearance, she felt dull and plain. Even her blue hair ribbons were wilted. Her teal eyes, now wet, bloodshot, and stinging, scanned the crowd with a silent plea: perhaps, any minute, her new ""uncle"" would come for her.",870118
305,"She""s pointing forward for no apparent reason, and her voice is booming throughout my room. ""Think about the bigger picture, Kyon! We could have a US Branch, and a European branch, and maybe a branch in Australia.....the possibilities are endless! There could be an SOS Brigade in every school all over the world!"" My response is turning around to ignore her, but she can""t seem to get the hint, and she keeps on speaking. ""...And so every single SOS Brigade will be dedicated to searching for unusual phenomenon like ours, and it""ll be mandatory for them to all have one mascot! Someone like Mikuru-chan is essential! Of course, I""ll be the International Brigade Commander of all of the SOS Brigades, since we did start it......Kyon! Are you even listening to me?"" she yells, before grabbing me by the back of my shirt and roughly pulling me off my bed. I land on the floor, and Haruhi is staring down at me like I""ve committed treason. Her eyes narrow as she speaks directly to me, and she""s poking at my chest. ""Listen, Kyon! You need to pay attention to me! Give some respect to your Brigade Chief!"" At this point, I""m extremely tired, and my limit is reaching its peak. Sure, being bossed around by Haruhi can be tolerable sometimes, but when it""s like this, well... ""You""re so stupid sometimes, Kyon! I wonder why I didn""t choose a more competent first member for the SOS Brigade..."" Haruhi said, and finally, something snaps in my head. ""Enough with the Brigade! You""re the one who forced me to join the stupid club in the first place! I didn""t even have a choice in the matter! Now please, Haruhi, can I just get some sleep?"" I nearly yelled back at her. In the instant I said those words; the expression on her face seemed to break. She started to look a little like Nagato, in that she wasn""t smiling, or frowning, or anything at all. She spoke softly to me as I looked up at her. ""Fine. I guess you can just get to sleep then."" Haruhi""s mood seemed to drop rapidly from that moment on, and as I crawled back into my bed, I could see she was turned away from me, probably staring at the wall. What I did wasn""t really so nice, but being tired as I was, I think I could have cared less at the moment. I was used to being bossed around so much by Haruhi, so I figured she needed to be challenged by someone else at least once in a while. I didn""t even take the time to say good night. My eyes were heavy enough that once I had turned over, pulling my covers over me, I could see my vision darkening as my eyes closed. The last thing I remember before falling asleep was only one word that I thought I heard Haruhi said. ""Kyon..."" After that, there was nothing at all. Just the blackness of sleep. EDIT: Chapter Fix I""m really amazed by all the feedback I""m getting for this story. It""s inspiring me! So, here comes the next chapter!_______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Sleep is usually a different experience every time it occurred for me.",967934
1235,"It makes this sacrifice even easier. I would only be the one to suffer. At least, my sufferings will not be in vain for I know that my country will benefit for it. ""Do you, Cagalli Yula Attha, accept Yuna Roma Seirin as your husband, in sickness and in health, for better and for worse?"" Deep in my heart, I hoped for Athrun... that somehow, he""d be here to break this wedding.. that somehow he""ll come and kick the ass of Yuna, carry me bridal-style and steal me away from here and we""ll leave happily ever after. But then, it only happens in fairy tales. ""I do..."" My feelings for Athrun didn""t matter anymore. This is my battle and I have chosen my answer. In one way or another, I still hope to believe that love isn""t just for the weak. s s Chapter 3 ""Cause we""ll find the way s s It was one of those days when she loved the rain. The droplets of water that pours down her delicate skin felt nice, for one. The gray clouds that hung above her head simply supplemented the way she felt: Hurt, lost, but free. Which is why she could be found standing at the park, her wedding gown soaking wet, her hair dishelmed, a blank expression on her face. The sight of the empty park seemed to content her. It was a rare chance to have this park by yourself. Somehow, she thanked the rain. Nothing could bee seen on her golden orbs... they were lost and even her rational mind couldn""t kick in and advise her to go hide. Hide, you ask? Well, for one, anyone who would find a lady dressed in her wedding gown in a park would definitely brand the scene as ""inconsiderably weird,' which would definitely caused too much attention- Cagalli hated attention. But it wasn""t really the reason for hiding. You see, Cagalli Yula Attha just ditched out her wedding. No one except her friends would understand what she did. Everyone thought she had her mind set. No one thought she would back out. ""I do... not want to marry you.' The words she uttered rang through her ears. She really didn""t know why she backed out. It was as if someone programmed her to say those words. She smiled weakly as she the scene a few minutes ago replayed on her mind. It was nice to run wearing your wedding gown, she learned. Maybe... she could do that again. Right now, nothing mattered to Cagalli. She just felt... free. She made a choice for herself. Then again, she always made decisions for herself. Isn""t the reason why she accepted Yuna""s proposal? To help her country? To decide for the sake of her people? Morally, what she did was wrong but then, some part of her wanted to reconsider the answer. She raised her head and allowed the raindrops to trace her face. She wanted, even just now, to feel at peace and forget all her problems. She never felt this light for a long time. Spending hours on your desk would do that to you. Athrun, it was all Athrun""s fault. Her mind wandered of to a certain blue-haired coordinator. She watched him, from the corner of her eye, as she walked down the isle. The bastard was smiling. If she were normal, Cagalli would have punch the wall that may even result to a crack of some sort.",560480
3569,"Eren was thinking of phrases- no, words to say, anything just to break the silence that overcame them. At the same time, he was wondering what Mikasa was going to do. She, too, just stood there, staring back at him. It took them a few seconds to realize their distances, as they both instantly looked back down at the sink spontaneously. ""I""ll dry the dishes."" Mikasa said as she moved to where Armin was. She didn""t even wait for Eren""s reply. ""Sure."" the brunet said. Ah dammit. What was I supposed to say? Eren thought, scraping the dirt off the dishes with a sponge.

2623,"I have fallen deeply in love with you..."" ""I also love you... Kikuchi... Let""s live the rest of our dull life together forever!"" And you know what happens next. Kikuchi shivered. That mental image was scary. Urgh. Yuck. It was as if taken from a romantic movie Onizuka watched where, well, there are some, well, you know... stuffs not for children below 18. ""Stupid,"" He scolded himself for his late thinking until he reached his house. Kikuchi""s place was a two-stories high house with walls painted in rich cream. It was not too big but just enough for his family. ""I""m home,"" he stated after entering the house. He was taking of his shoes when he noticed something very intriguing. Two pairs of shoes - white sandals, and leather black shoes, were placed neatly on the door. Hmm... dinner would be in a few minutes so... did his mom invite some friends over? Come to think of it, she said something of that sort this morning... but... why does he feel that he have seen these already? Shaking the thought of, he proceeded to his room. He might have seen those at stores or something. Halfway through the stairs, his mother""s voice called him. ""Yoshito! We have guests! I believe you will be very happy to see them."" He sighed. Not now. Just when he thought he could rest his tired brain, he was forced to interact with guests. One of the things Kikuchi Yoshito hated was socializing where you must act formally, smile non-stop and pretend you are REALLY interested to what the guests were talking about. He took his time going to the dinning room where his mothers"" guests were. He ran a hand to his brown locks before entering. What he saw made his jaw drop. Ishikawa Rhine and Kirizawa Takeshi were sitting on the table, enjoying dinner, talking animatedly with his mother. Does fate really hate him that much? ""We were getting hungry so we decided to eat before you came. Look who we have here, Rhine and her friend, Takeshi,"" his mother said, a smile on her face. She motioned her son to sit beside her. ""Come now or the food will get cold."" ""I""ve already eaten, mom,"" he answered shortly. His mother""s smile faded a little, a pout was threatening to show, ""Don""t you like my coking?"" ""It""s not that, I""m just full,"" he explained. Kikuchi narrowed his eyes. Somehow, Takeshi was looking at him with those dull orbs that seem to hold more than what others see. Mental note to Kikuchi, never under-estimate this Kirizawa guy. ""Anyway, Rhine is here. Surely, you would like to chat with her."" ""Actually, we""ve met a while ago,"" Rhine informed sweetly while looking innocently at Kikuchi. ""And.. I""ve already met his girlfriend,"" she added, twisting the fork on her pasta with too much force. And.. I""ve already met his girlfriend And.. I""ve already met his girlfriend And.. I""ve already met his girlfriend What... the... heck... Kikuchi""s eyes widened mentally as Rhine""s words registered in his mind. Surely, he wasn""t expecting this witch to really tell his mother about his so-called girlfriend! What will he do?! Think Kikuchi! Think! Excuses, excuses, where art though?!",560480
1749,"We went from the northern parts of Dorne when I was ten, all the way south to here, and she took the name Myrna. That""s when the man""s men stopped harassing us."" ""I see. How..."" Tyrion swallowed thickly, ""How did she live before you moved to the farm here?"" My gaze fell. We didn""t like remembering those times. Mother never spoke of them, and I didn""t like the nightmares she gave me. Of the life we lived, of having to hide in closets and under the beds as she serviced men in the brothel... I could see in Tyrion""s face that I didn""t need to answer. He knew what I was thinking. ""She shouldn""t be here,"" Tyrion said, though to me or himself I couldn""t tell, ""We were legally married for a short time. My father had the marriage annulled quickly. She... be the Lady of Casterly Rock right now. Or..."" His thumb passed over the length of the stone, ""Or possibly buried there, I suppose."" Then, for the first time since we""d left the shack, he looked me full in the face, ""With the timing, you were conceived when we were still wed. Had it lasted, you would have been our trueborn daughter."" Then, his other hand fisted in the sand and grass, ""You should be trueborn."" There it was. It fell like an anvil over me, adding a weight I hadn""t felt before to my shoulders. The coins, her grave, our matching stories, his looks, my looks, her looks. There was no denying the fact that the dwarfish man kneeling next to me atop my mother""s grave was my father. Tyrion Lannister, Hand of the King and Lord of House Lannister, was my father. ""But I was not born in wedlock, not technically,"" I forced a smile, ""I am a bastard."" ""Aye,"" Tyrion almost smiled, as if at some unseen joke, ""I am a dwarf and you are a bastard."" He said it so nonchalantly, with no shame or disappointment in his voice at all. As if the two distinctions were equivalent. As if they didn""t matter at all. He turned to me, sizing me up with a glance, and stood, ""I am leaving in a week for King""s Landing. I have duties there, and the King can only spare me so long."" He chuckled and muttered under his breath, ""That man would be lost without me and his sister."" Then Tyrion stared me in the eyes again, looking down for once as I still sat on the ground, ""I would wish you to accompany me."" ""I won""t be legitimized as a Lannister, milord,"" I didn""t stand. Somehow it felt easier to talk to him when we were of a more similar height. ""I didn""t ask that,"" I could feel him wanting to roll his eyes, but he didn""t, ""Though the thought did cross my mind. Someday in the future, perhaps. And besides-"" He looked back at the shack, then around at the farm, ""-the only one whose permission I would need to legitimize you is the King""s."" I opened my mouth to protest, but he shushed me with a hand, ""But I am not the sort of man to force anything on a woman. No, I merely wish to get to know the woman my Tysha raised all on her own. Nothing more, nothing less..."" Then, a crooked smile. This one crinkled less of his scars, ""Though you would have access to any of the Maester""s in King""s Landing. Or any of the sights around the city.""",748687
3471,"Lois and Clark hear about the matter and want to find out what has caused those strange ailments. A new virus, maybe? But when they want to interview the victims, two Chicago detectives deny them access to them. They introduce themselves as agents of a bureau called ""Special Unit 2"", and they have recently investigated a similar case in Chicago. They have therefore been authorized by the FBI to head the Metropolis investigation as well, but they remain silent about the case. Moreover, one of them, Nick O""Malley, has a strange aversion to Superman and refuses his help. Fortunately, Lois has more luck with Agent Kate Benson. She learns that Special Unit 2 is responsible for ""links"", creatures that originate from the famous missing link between animals and human beings. And one of those links is now apparently plying its dangerous trades in Metropolis: A genuine Greek Sphinx, who takes the eyesight of everyone who cannot solve her riddles... This episode is a crossover with ""Special Unit 2"". The Sphinx already turned up in this show and has now moved to Metropolis. This episode has some very funny moments to offer, for example Nick""s constant hostility towards Superman, whom he thinks to be a link as well. Nick takes some time to understand that not all links are evil. The actor who plays Nick, Michael Landes, used to play Jimmy Olsen during the first ""Superman"" season, before he was replaced by Justin Whalin.5.09: Follow The Green Brick Road Moirag has crafted a new, perfidious plan to get rid of Superman. Employing an old Haitian Voodoo spell, she invokes a magician, who helps her setting a trap for Superman: The Man of Steel is banned into another dimension, which is almost the same as the present. There is only one crucial difference: In this dimension, Clark Kent has never existed. Clark becomes a ""John Doe"", a man without an identity. His only connection to his old life is Moirag, who can move between the dimensions without any problem. And it is her who tells him how to get back home: He has to follow the long, green brick road. There is only one problem: This road is paved with Cryptonite... This episode alludes to the fantasy classic ""The Wizard of Oz"", where the farmer girl Dorothy is transported into another world. Just like Dorothy, Clark has to find his way back to Kansas. 5.10: When You""re Good To Mama Gene Carter is new in Metropolis and gets a job at the ""Daily Planet"". Soon he and Jimmy have become inseparable friends. Lois and Clark watch their young friend with mixed feelings as he is distancing himself more and more from them, letting the harmonic family life in the house of Carter absorb him. Mrs. Carter, Genes mother, showers Jimmy with affection, and soon she treats him as her own son. When the whole thing is giving Jimmy the creeps, he tries to evade Mrs. Carter""s influence. But he has to learn that Mrs. Carter fights like a tigress for her children - and she already regards Jimmy as her child as well.",240213
2284,"""Well he did say to make myself at home"" Brenda poured herself a bow of cereal and sat down, she glanced down and caught a glimpse of David and Steve from a group photo that was taken back in high school, she picked up the picture and smiled. She really did miss David sure they weren""t the closest but they were friends, she glanced at the picture again. She missed David but she missed Steve more, right before she left she felt as if they formed a strong bond. Right before she left they had gotten really close, after the whole Laura thing she saw Steve and their friendship in a new light and she truly did miss him when she left. She had once gotten a letter from him saying that he getting married to this girl named Janet that was pregnant with his child, in the letter he said that he desperately wanted her to come. Of course she never showed, she didn""t even write him back telling that she wasn""t going to come. There was so many things going on with her back then that she didn""t have the courage to write him back, he must hate her, ever since that day her and Steve haven""t talked. A knock at the door pulled her back to reality, she looked over at Dylan, seeing that he was out cold she got up and answered the door herself, and the person that was on the other side made her gasp, it was no other than Steve Sanders. Steve stared back at Brenda with shock in his eyes, she was the last person he had expected to see. The last time he had had any sort of contact with Brenda was when he wrote her a letter inviting her to his wedding and to his disappointment she never showed, she didn""t even have the courtesy to write him back saying that she wasn""t going to show, after that day he had given up on any sort of communication with her, but here she was. ""Brenda? Is that you?"" Steve blinking trying to make sure that it wasn""t a dream. Brenda had expected Steve to be upset, to yell, to holler or to just leave but what he did shocked the hell out of Brenda. He hugged her. He held on to her like this was their last minute together, he wanted to be mad at her but he wasn""t, he was just happy to see her, she was still the same beautiful Brenda. ""My god Bren, when did you get back?"" They sat down in the kitchen. ""Like five or six hours ago"" ""You were the last person I expected to see, I came over here to see Dylan and I got you. I should come see Dylan more often."" Brenda smiled and opened her mouth to say something but closed it again. ""You never showed up. I waited and waited and then I realized that you weren""t going to show"" ""I""m sorry. I wanted to come, I really did. But so many things were going on with me at the time that I couldn""t deal with coming back. So many emotions were going through me and I was... guess afraid to come back.

Then the Moralton citizens grab Mojo and strip him of his weapons and jetpack and then as Dr. Potterswheel prepares his euthanizing equiptment Mojo Jojo then shouts, ""Hey...what are you doing?"" Mojo sees the needle and he continues, ""Oh no... You""re not going to...If you are then why? All I was doing was destroying your town!""

2658,"""I always respected you, thought you were strong. But if you stay up here crying, I""m going to have to rethink what I think of you."" Mira snarled at that, a bit of her former self coming back, ""Like I care what you think of me."" Laxus smirked at the appearance of old Mira. ""You should. Fairy Tail will be mine someday, and I""ll kick out any weaklings not pulling their weight. Find your fangs again, demon."" ""Fuck you Laxus,"" she had yelled at his retreating form. Mira hated to admit it, but it had been Laxus"" harsh words that caused her to finally heal and begin to get over Lisanna""s death. She knew the master wouldn""t kick her out, but the worry was there, and she and Elfman still had no other place to go, so she began tending bar to pull her weight. She had to adopt a friendlier persona to do her job properly, which had led to the modeling. Both tasks kept her busy enough to gradually come to terms with her missing sister. All because Laxus had been a jerk where everyone else had been compassionate. She wondered how he would react now. He still was a jerk, but so much...better? Was that the word she was looking for? He had changed but not so much that he was unrecognizable. The Thunder Legion began taking more jobs by themselves, wanting to show that they were worthy of Laxus and to get closer to achieving S Class status. This left Laxus at the Fairy Tail bar more by himself. He usually wouldn""t have spent much time at the guild with his friends gone, but he still was making an effort to be friendlier with everyone else. Though he still stayed out of the bar-wide brawls, rolling his eyes at their childishness. Mira found herself talking with him more. Unlike Wakaba and Macao, Laxus wasn""t much older than her. So when he flirted with her, she normally flirted back rather than politely indulged. This was another point where she should have realized that something was different with Laxus because she almost never flirted back with customers past politeness. Their relationship had evolved into a friendship, not that he was as close to her as Erza or her siblings, but she could read him better now. She understood him more. He seemed to have the same feelings towards her, he cared but she wasn""t quite on the same level of his Thunder Legion or his grandfather. Until the day that all changed. It hadn""t started as a different day. Erza and Makarov were gone doing Guild Master work, her siblings and the Thunder Legion were out on jobs, but Laxus had been home since the day before, wanting to wait before accepting the next job. Natsu and Gray had gotten into a fight, which was also no surprise, but the damage had been worse than usual. Bad enough that Laxus had ended the fight, knocking out both of the young men and throwing them out on the street. Most of the bar cleared out after that, as Laxus"" temper wasn""t a pleasant thing to experience. Mira had closed early due to the damage and Laxus had stayed behind to help. ""I appreciate it, but I don""t need your help, Laxus."" Mira pushed against a fallen beam that went nowhere.",1497577

""Don""t be silly. We""ll let them know they died honorably in the Games and..."" ""They won""t care. They won""t want to hear it. You won""t be comforting them. They won""t love you for it.

It won""t matter anyway."" Effie recognized that Haymitch had gotten her name right, but she ignored that, simply saying, ""It matters to me."" Haymitch said nothing. He knew she wouldn""t be welcome, but he found himself admiring her for making the effort. No one else did, not even him. As predicted, both of the families reacted badly to Effie""s words. One slammed the door shut in her face and the other spit at her feet before slamming the door shut. Effie wasn""t one to be put out though, and she acted as if it had all gone very well. Haymitch had refused to go with her to deliver the coffins, but did see her off at the station. She was smiling again, ""At least we""ll go to the Victor""s Ball."" ""What?"" ""At the President""s house. All the past victors are invited; I figured I could be your date. Besides it""s a great opportunity to court more sponsors for next year and thank our previous one."" Haymitch would say nothing to that man though he might throw up on him if he saw him again. He knew what reaction that would bring so he talked about Effie""s previous comment instead. ""That""s awfully presumptuous of you."" ""Did you have plans to invite someone else?"" She actually seemed surprised and maybe a little hurt. Actually he never went; the entire event pissed him off. ""I""m not going."" ""You have to."" She looked at him. ""Of course we""ll need to go shopping first."" Who was this woman? ""What?"" She noticed his sour look, so she explained, ""We should coordinate; present a united front, being from the same district. I was thinking we could both dress in black, being from the coal district and all. I""ve already ordered my hair."" ""You aren""t from District 12. I will not be going shopping with you or to the Victor""s ball."" She ignored him, pressing something into his hand. ""I already got you special permission to come a day early to the Capitol so we could pick out your clothes."" She looked at his current outfit again. ""We""ll also pick up something for you to wear for next year""s games."" Haymitch clenched the ticket, seriously who was this woman? ""I""m not going. Effie, are you listening to me? I will not be going shopping or to the ball."" She patted his checks as though he were a child. ""I""ll see you in a few months, Haymitch."" She went to board the train and he called out after her. ""No you will not. We will see each other at the next reaping and no sooner."" A few months later, Haymitch found himself in the Capitol, shopping.",1497577
1598,"""I""m sorry Jack"" Jack continues to look at Fi and sees the hurt in her eyes. Carey, Annie and Clu just remain quiet not knowing what to do. ""Jack you had your chance to make your sister happy now give me mine. I can love her for who she is something you could never do. She is going to live here with me"" Wind blows through the house and Fi and Jack are getting farther and farther away. Jack looks at his sister who is growing more distant. No time like the present. ""You don""t even know her"" The wind continues to blow and it starts to rain. ""What are you talking about Jack? I see her for who she is... I know her more then you ever will"" ""See Daniel that is where you are wrong. You don""t know her. What is her favorite color?"" Silence. ""Blue except on Mondays...Mondays she likes the color red, she thinks liking only one thing makes you dull and boring. Her favorite cartoon show when she was younger was Scooby Doo and her favorite character was Thelma because Thelma was so smart. She only likes my mom doing her hair because she says I pull her hair too tight and make her pony-tail lopsided but I""m the only one she likes kissing her boo-boo""s but of course that was when she was 10. She cries over the silliest of things... she cried for days after watching Old Yeller. She always bites on her bottom lip when she is nervous... her feet do the jello dance when she is excited and her favorite movie is E.T and she thinks that Drew Barrymore was so cute in that movie."" Fi looks at Jack and smiles. ""Oh so you know stuff... but I will make her happy ... that is the big plan"" ""No. The big plan is for me and her to grow old together. We are gonna be 99 and still fighting over if aliens exist or not. I""m supposed to scare off all of her boyfriends. I""m supposed to hold her after her first break up with a guy. I""m supposed to make chicken noodle soup every time she is sick. Hold her and reassure everything is okay when she is afraid. Trade phone calls and write letters if she goes to a different college then me. Think of her when she is not near me. Stay up late with her listening to her awesome date or party she went to even if I really want to go to sleep. We""re supposed to share juicy secrets with each other but she""ll always keep the ones about all the boys that like her to herself cause she knows I""ll hunt them down and kill them myself. We""re supposed to be there for each other.... Comforting each other. We""ll have fights but we will always make up by the end of the night because we both know how short life can be. I""m supposed to say I love you a million times and annoy the heck out of her. I""m supposed to be extremely happy when she gets married and take tons of pictures... that is the big plan. Cause I love her no matter what... I love all her little quirks and flaws... I love her for who she is and not for whom I want her to be because she is who I want her to be. I see who she is and I am never disappointed in her because everyday I look at her I see an angel... my angel"" Daniel looked at Jack and saw that his feelings were sincere.",29783
2857,"""Yeah, put it out!"" Heymans Breda, the last of Mustang""s three paralegals, said, coming up to stand beside Havoc. In a quick motion, he snatched the cigarette from between Havoc""s lips and pressed it into the ashtray. ""Just because you want lung cancer doesn""t mean the rest of us do."" Havoc glowered, ""Hey! Not cool, man!"" Mustang rolled his eyes at their antics. ""Where""s Hawkeye?"" He asked the rest of his team (Havoc and Breda were still bickering behind him) as he placed the coffees and muffin on his desk. Kain Fury, a young tech wizard looked up. ""I think she""s at the police station. She got a tip from one of her contacts that there might be a case,"" he said in an uncertain voice. He was the newest member of the team, and quite an anomaly. It was highly unusual for a legal team to have a tech guy as a member, but with a little push from Mustang, the senior partners had given him permission to hire Fury. Fury""s insights on any technical aspects of cases were invaluable. Plus, Mustang liked the kid, even if he was constantly nervous. ""Falman?"" Mustang asked the final member of his team, their information coordinator. Vato Falman had an excellent memory, perfect for keeping track of every piece of info in cases as well as having aptitude for remembering even the most obscure and outdated laws. Falman stood straight up as Mustang called his name. ""Yes, sir! Fury is correct, sir. She left for the precinct about half an hour before you arrived. She said she would call you with an update after she had more information!"" Mustang sighed. Falman was definitely efficient, but he could stand to loosen up a little. ""Did she leave any details about what the case might be about?"" ""She did not sir!"" ""Thanks, Falman,"" Mustang said, waving his hand to tell the tall man to return to work. He sat down at his desk and opened the nearest file. They had just been in court the previous week, which meant that Mustang had a fairly light load of work. He just had to finish up some paperwork for their last client, and then it would be time to start a new case. He spared a moment to wonder what the one Hawkeye was looking into was. Staking out the police station was a fairly common gig for associates. They were all scrambling to get as many hours as possible as well as to bring in big clients to impress the partners. Soon, however, they almost all realized that it was simply more trouble than it was worth. They might be able to pick up a few extra hours, but fishing for clients was almost always a bust. The ones that were rich enough to impress the partners always had their own attorneys. Sometimes, the associates would get lucky, and catch someone just firing an incompetent lawyer, or perhaps someone who had just come into money. All in all though, these cases were fairly rare and ultimately the slim chance was not worth the subway ride to the station. The idea of a partner staking out the police station was almost unheard of. They were big enough and had proven themselves competent enough that the clients came to them.",2943978

1957,"Jake turned to try and go the other way dragging me again, but a horseman blocked his path instantly, as she too held her bow at him. Finally giving up Jake held up his hands and dropped the knife as I clung to him worried he was going to get himself killed by doing something stupid. Suddenly the woman Na""vi from early came crashing down next to us yelling in Na""vi, ""Calm people, calm."" Tsu""tey""s P.O.V Sliding off the animal I had been riding I walked over to Neytiri as she angrily growled, ""What are you doing, Tsu""tey."" With anger at her own stupidity for bring these dreamwalkers here I growled, ""These demons are forbidden here."" All the while my eyes traveled over the two captives. I was looking at the male first wit a scowl until my eyes quickly caught the female. She was tall, very slender, and she held her self with pride and dignity as if she was a chief""s daughter. Her hair was different though. The color was as light brown as home tree, and her eyes...they were as blue as the sky when lit by the midday sun, but they held this bitterness, coldness, inside them. They showed no fear, just anger as she held my own. How long had she been staring me down? My scowl grew when what must have been her mate leaned in and brought her closer to him. ""There has been a sign. This is a matter for the Tsahik,"" Neytiri threw back at me as I turned my eyes on her once more. Looking between her and the sky-people I quickly made my choice, ""Bring them."" Linking back with my animal I threw myself back on top and turned my eyes away from the beautiful vision that stood next to the ignorant ingrate. Mia""s P.O.V I tried to make it seem like I didn""t understand as I listened, but it was becoming harder as I glared down the man who was challenging the Na""vi woman who had saved us. His eyes caught mine after a while and he continued to stare for a few moments, a little more than he needed to before turning back to listen to woman. I only found two words I didn""t know, Tsahik, and Tsu""tey, which I guessed was names of people. One being the name of the Na""vi man standing in front us, I think his name was Tsu""tey. ""Bring them,"" he said in Na""vi before walking back to his horse and connecting his...hair...the squid thingy at the end...to the horse""s antenna. Suddenly there was some commotion and Jake asked, directing his question to the woman, ""What""s goin"" on?"" Suddenly the other Na""vi from behind us grabbed us roughly and began to move us forward as they followed the leader of the group. ""What""s happening, HEY,"" he called out again as they pushed us. Whatever was going on, or for whatever reason they were taking us I had a weird feeling in the pit of my stomach about it. PRETTY PLEASE REVIEW! +The Na""vi+ Mia""s P.O.V We were led through the jungle up to a large, okay VERY BIG tree. It would have brought all the Red Wood Forest to a deep agonizing shame.

2488,"She smiled and pleasantly agreed to fetch their drinks, despite her internal disquiet. Upon returning the man ordered two different four-course meals, consisting of appetizers, the main course, cheese course and dessert. The boy listened as the man spoke in semi-decent French, expertly asking for adjustments to taste. Meiko had to scribble quickly to avoid making a mistake. The boy""s eyes got rounder and rounder, and by the time Konishi was done speaking, he looked a bit appalled. ""Surely we""re not going to eat all that!"" he protested. ""I don""t even know what any of it is!"" ""Didn""t I promise you an adventure, Kasahara-kun?"" The man sounded amused. ""You don""t need to eat everything, but you should at least be willing to try a bite of each dish. Who knows? You may discover a new favorite food."" She paused to catch her breath after dropping the order off in the kitchen. The restaurant was fairly quiet, and Kasahara and Konishi were the only ones sitting in her section. Standing behind the kitchen door, she peered out the window, trying to pinpoint why she wasn""t comfortable with this pair. On the surface, they were pleasant enough, thanking her for the drinks and not treating her like she was a piece of the restaurant""s furniture. Both were easy on the eyes, and Kasahara was so charmingly naïve that a part of her wanted to pat him on the head, like a puppy. Konishi was tall, dark and handsome, exactly the type of man she""d like to date. Nanako, returning from delivering dessert to one of her tables while humming the tune of Fuwa Shou""s latest song, noticed her introspection. ""Something wrong?"" the older waitressed queried. ""No... at least, I don""t think so,"" she corrected thoughtfully. ""Just a little mystery I""m trying to figure out."" ""Oh?"" Nanako canted her head to the side, her curiosity plainly written on her face. ""I""m having a hard time figuring out what that pair is doing together,"" she said, pointing to Konishi""s table. ""They don""t seem to be related, they""re the wrong age to be friends, and... well, they just don""t match."" ""Ah?"" Nanako, who was a good four inches shorter than Meiko, raised herself up on her toes to get a better look out the window. After about ten seconds, she started to giggle, letting herself settle back onto her feet. ""I think it""s pretty obvious."" ""Huh?"" ""Well... you know,"" Nanako said, holding up her little finger. ""Like that."" Meiko blinked, recognizing the relationship implication Nanako was making. Then she started shaking her head. ""No, that can""t be right."" Nanako""s face turned sly. ""Watch their body language and tell me that,"" she said, before giving Meiko a playful shove toward the kitchen. ""Bring their appetizers, and you""ll see what I mean."" Feeling a bit rigid, Meiko did as Nanako told her. She returned to the table to set the appetizers down - crudites and caviar - before stepping back. ""Enjoy,"" she invited. Neither of them turned to acknowledge her, their attention focused entirely on each other. The boy reached over to spoon a large clump of caviar onto a cracker, but Konishi caught him by the wrist.",1112924
2728,"Have you been eating chocolate whiskey again?"" I produced a small ""huh?' and stared at Mayaka-san. Am I... that red? ""Ah! No, I am not... I was..."" ""Thinking of Oreki?"" Waah! Please don""t say that out loud, Mayaka-san! She had a teasing smile on her face... it was as if she had a lot of plans lingering on her mind. ""Come on, Chi-chan. We""ll read shoujo mangas so that you can understand those feelings of yours. Or at least give you advice."" I followed her in the library. We went to the manga section of the library and I found a lot of them! It was amazing... ""Here""s a good manga, Chi-chan!"" ""Eh? Thank you, Mayaka-san."" She handed me the manga and we both read it. I discovered a lot of stuff about this ""love"" thing. Why do girls cry after confessing? Then I evaluated myself mentally. I did confess right? B-but... I haven""t told him that I like him! Oh my... what will I do? ""Chi-chan... are you alright?"" ""I haven""t told Oreki-san that I like him!"" Eh? I said that out loud, haven""t I? I touched my blushing cheeks in deep embarrassment. I am so sorry Mayaka-san! But instead of being as flustered as I am, Mayaka-san giggled at me. ""Oh, Chi-chan! You""re so innocent!"" ""Huh? What do you mean?"" ""Never mind that. Since you haven""t told him yet, why don""t you tell him? Perhaps tomorrow?"" I fidgeted with my hands; I don""t think I can... ""What if he doesn""t feel the same way?"" I asked, the worry obvious in my voice. Mayaka-san gave me a smile. ""You don""t know that yet. Who knows, maybe he does."" Mayaka-san is right. He might. But... he might not as well. I gave a long sigh, to show my defeat. ""You""re right. I guess I should. Tomorrow, I will tell him."" Yosh. I am really determined for tomorrow! Uh... am I really? ""Mayaka-san..."" ""Yes?"" ""Do you think I should ask Oreki-san why have I liked him?"" Mayaka-san gave me an odd stare. ""I guess so... Why do you like him anyway?"" I paused and thought about it. ""I don""t really know why. That""s why I am so curious about it."" ""Chi-chan... love is like that, you know. You""ll never know why you liked him. Look at this manga..."" Oh. I""ll never... know why I liked him? That""s... that""s so... mysterious! I am curious! So this is what happened in the part where Chi-chan and Mayaka went to the library and Oreki is absolutely clueless about that. While Satoshi was cornering Oreki, Mayaka is giving Chi-chan a lending hand~ this is basically like an omake. See ya""ll in a week or so! Just great. After telling myself that I would never tell anyone what happened yesterday, there I was, telling Satoshi everything. I rolled over on my bed, the frustration going deeper and deeper. And now, the question is getting more and more annoying. Because I can""t even answer it! Though, I could ask my sis- what am I thinking?! Why would I even think about involving my sister in things that she can tease me about? I mean, I could die of a nervous breakdown since no one can answer my questions, but I can also die of deep shame because of my sister. Dieing with a breakdown it is. ""Houtarou~!"" My sister called.",2750536
1642,"Kirk shot him a death glare which was considerably lacking when compared to Uhura""s. ""Traitor,"" he mumbled under his breath. ""I trust this personal disagreement will not affect you two working together,"" Pike said, eyebrows raised. Uhura turned to him. ""Not at all. I""m a professional."" ""It""s nice to know someone here is,"" Bones muttered, looking at his best friend. ""What? I""m unprofessional? She slapped me!"" Kirk said, once again seeming incredibly offended. ""Perhaps it""d be best if we moved on,"" Pike suggested. ""As you undoubtedly know, Uhura is a very competent actress, so she will be handling the casing as well as any potential... role playing the job may require."" ""Actress my ass. Con-artist is more like it,"" Kirk muttered under his breath. Everyone else was content to ignore him. ""In addition to Ms. Uhura, we have Montgomery Scott our ballistics expert."" He gestured to a man who was possibly the most Scottish looking person Bones had ever seen, even with the lack of a kilt and bagpipes. ""Call me Scotty,"" he said, reaching a hand out to both Bones and Kirk in turn, a smile stretching across his face. ""Don""t worry, I""m not gonna slap ya,"" he said, amusement in his eyes as he warmly shook hands with Kirk. Kirk grumbled something under his breath, which was, once again, ignored. ""So, Mr. Scott will be in charge of weapons, explosives, and any other devices of a more volatile nature that we may have a need for."" The Scotsman nodded in acknowledgment. Pike moved on to the next person, a younger man who looked like he could be of Japanese or maybe Korean descent. ""This is Hikaru Sulu. He""s the best getaway driver you could hope for and an expert in combat fighting. ""It""s nice to meet you both,"" Sulu said, shaking Kirk and Bones"" hands. ""What kind of combat style are you trained in?"" Bones asked. Sulu smiled. ""I""m a master fencer."" He chuckled at the other man""s surprised and vaguely worried expression. ""Don""t worry, I""m also good with a gun and even know some hand-to-hand combat, so I""m far from useless. Even without a saber."" ""I""m more concerned with how a getaway driver becomes the best,"" Kirk said, smirking. ""Is there some sort of driving test specifically designed for avoiding cops? Did you score the highest?"" Surprisingly, the man in front of him seemed to consider the question seriously. ""Well I""m not sure if you""d count two years as a professional driver for action movies a ""driving test specifically designed for avoiding cops,' but if so, yes I scored the highest."" A small smile at Kirk""s surprised expression proved that the man had accomplished what he meant to. ""And I can assure you that I""m just as adept at driving as I am at swordplay."" Bones chucked and turned back to Pike, and the two men beside him still waiting to be introduced. Well men may have been an exaggeration; one of them didn""t look like he could be more than sixteen. ""This is Pavel Chekov,"" Pike said, motioning to the kid. Clearly Russian, he still had the wide-eyed innocence of someone in grade school.",2943978
3179,"""I mean, a guy you""ve never met approaches you in a bar, while you were illegally gambling I may add, and asks you to rob a bank for him?"" Bones said. ""Doesn""t that seem a little suspicious to you? And the only proof that he gives you to trust him is that he knew your dad?"" Kirk nodded. ""Yep."" He jumped up, his energy nearly boiling over. ""C""mon, grab your coat! It""s 2:45, we don""t want to be late!"" ""No, of course not,"" Bones grumbled, but grudgingly he got up and followed Kirk to the door. ""I""ve met some of your father""s friends,"" he said. ""Didn""t like them."" ""Pike is different."" Bones turned at the sudden seriousness in Kirk""s voice. ""Different how?"" Kirk was pulling on his coat, not looking at Bones. ""Just different."" Bones knew when pushing his friend wasn""t a good idea, so instead he huffed a sigh, reached up, and grabbed his own coat from where it hung behind the door. As he put it on, he glanced at the apartment surrounding them. He and Kirk were roommates, had been for almost three years. They had met through an ad of all things. After Bones"" wife divorced him, he""d been forced to get his own place. Unfortunately, he couldn""t pay for it on his nonexistent salary, and that was where Kirk had come in. A juvenile delinquent straight off the streets, he had been the only offer Bones"" got as a roommate. Luckily, his petty crime more than paid the rent, and much to Bones"" amazement, he somehow managed to continuously avoid the police. Against his better judgment, Bones had gotten attached to the kid, and even more than a little involved with his less-than-legal pastimes, which was how he ended up heading off to plan a bank robbery. ""C""mon, Bones!"" Kirk called, who was already out the door. ""What""re you doing?"" ""Appreciating my freedom before it gone,"" he replied, falling easily back into his grumpy self. Kirk laughed. ""It""s a crappy apartment, not exactly Buckingham Palace."" ""Just wait. You""ll miss it when you""re in a prison cell with a roommate named Bubba."" Pike""s place was just as ritzy as Bones had anticipated. Big white columns stretched over the enormous porch holding up what Bones considered an overly pretentious Greek style gable. What possible reason could there be for a house to have this type of architecture? He huffed in annoyance. ""Something wrong?"" Kirk asked beside him, irritating grin still plastered across his face. He was much too peppy for someone who was about to plan a bank robbery. ""Looks like a courthouse. I""m appreciating the irony."" Kirk slapped his back again. ""Appreciate it inside. We""re late."" Bones muttered something that was not meant for the ears of small children. Kirk leapt up the stairs and grasped the huge knocker on the door. He turned back to his friend. ""You comin""?"" Reluctantly Bones trudged after him. By the time he reached the door, Kirk had already knocked. They waited a few seconds and it opened, presenting a man maybe twenty years older than Bones. ""Pike!"" Kirk said jovially. ""I expected a butler with this kind of bling,"" he said, pointing at the elaborate brass knocker in the middle of the door.",2943978
3115,"""I always respected you, thought you were strong. But if you stay up here crying, I""m going to have to rethink what I think of you."" Mira snarled at that, a bit of her former self coming back, ""Like I care what you think of me."" Laxus smirked at the appearance of old Mira. ""You should. Fairy Tail will be mine someday, and I""ll kick out any weaklings not pulling their weight. Find your fangs again, demon."" ""Fuck you Laxus,"" she had yelled at his retreating form. Mira hated to admit it, but it had been Laxus"" harsh words that caused her to finally heal and begin to get over Lisanna""s death. She knew the master wouldn""t kick her out, but the worry was there, and she and Elfman still had no other place to go, so she began tending bar to pull her weight. She had to adopt a friendlier persona to do her job properly, which had led to the modeling. Both tasks kept her busy enough to gradually come to terms with her missing sister. All because Laxus had been a jerk where everyone else had been compassionate. She wondered how he would react now. He still was a jerk, but so much...better? Was that the word she was looking for? He had changed but not so much that he was unrecognizable. The Thunder Legion began taking more jobs by themselves, wanting to show that they were worthy of Laxus and to get closer to achieving S Class status. This left Laxus at the Fairy Tail bar more by himself. He usually wouldn""t have spent much time at the guild with his friends gone, but he still was making an effort to be friendlier with everyone else. Though he still stayed out of the bar-wide brawls, rolling his eyes at their childishness. Mira found herself talking with him more. Unlike Wakaba and Macao, Laxus wasn""t much older than her. So when he flirted with her, she normally flirted back rather than politely indulged. This was another point where she should have realized that something was different with Laxus because she almost never flirted back with customers past politeness. Their relationship had evolved into a friendship, not that he was as close to her as Erza or her siblings, but she could read him better now. She understood him more. He seemed to have the same feelings towards her, he cared but she wasn""t quite on the same level of his Thunder Legion or his grandfather. Until the day that all changed. It hadn""t started as a different day. Erza and Makarov were gone doing Guild Master work, her siblings and the Thunder Legion were out on jobs, but Laxus had been home since the day before, wanting to wait before accepting the next job. Natsu and Gray had gotten into a fight, which was also no surprise, but the damage had been worse than usual. Bad enough that Laxus had ended the fight, knocking out both of the young men and throwing them out on the street. Most of the bar cleared out after that, as Laxus"" temper wasn""t a pleasant thing to experience. Mira had closed early due to the damage and Laxus had stayed behind to help. ""I appreciate it, but I don""t need your help, Laxus."" Mira pushed against a fallen beam that went nowhere.",1497577

She""s from Japan; she""s all about keeping her Zen more than Zen."" The Detroit girl""s arms gesture wildly as she describes her companion, ""She does tai-chi, and karate and all kinds of shit. And she""s blind too, so don""t make fun of her for that or ask her to read any books."" Finally they reach an unmarked steel door which once had a sign posted on it but has since been ripped down. Scout smiles as they reach the door. ""And here we go."" Without further warning, the petite Detroit girl kicks the door open and runs like hell. Inside, the Demowoman is trying to take a shit while reading a braille newspaper. Instantly, the blind woman""s jaw drops in shock. Without a word, she reaches down into her pants and pulls out a silenced handgun. The Demowoman puts five bullets into the cameraman and the rest of the documentary crew run like hell. Basically a slow Monday for the demo. After things have died down and Mann Co has compensated the family of the murdered camera man, the documentary crew are seated in Demowoman""s real office. Everything is austere and Spartan.",1220273
70,"I can already tell you that he won""t say yes, even to me, but I""ll bring it up. [Jumin Han]: And you underestimate the power you have over that man, even after only seven days. [Aya]: ... Excuse me? [Jumin Han]: Never mind. When and where should I have Driver Kim pick you up? There was something giddy to this conversation now. I could feel anxiety and nervousness mixing in the pit of my stomach, but something else overpowered them both. Excitement. But I knew that neither Luciel nor the elusive V wanted the apartment address to get out, and I wasn""t too keen on anyone knowing my address just yet either, so... [Aya]: Um... there""s a cafe a ways from the apartment. Here""s the address; *pastes link* Is that alright? [Jumin Han]: Yes that""s fine. Time? I can have Driver Kim there in an hour. I looked at the time on my phone. I didn""t really know how long it would take to get to Zen""s, so looked that up first. Should I tell him I was coming? It was sudden, and he""d see it the moment he went into the chatroom, but... That new giddiness inside of me kinda liked the idea of it being g a surprise. [Aya]: How about eleven? I can get there for lunch. [Jumin Han]: That works well for my schedule. Driver Kim will be instructed to pick you up at that cafe, then chaperone you during the visit at Zen""s. The idea of a chaperone for two adults was odd, especially for my American sensibility, but I have the okay. I remembered Jaehee""s words about protecting Zen""s reputation, so it only made sense. I guess. Zen probably wouldn""t like it, though. But none of that really mattered at this point. I was going to see Zen. In person. Suddenly, nervousness and anticipation flooded me for the first time in years. I was a hurricane, running here and there trying to find something to wear, what to bring, thinking about what to say... This was unlike me, but I didn""t care. I felt odd, renewed in a sort of way, and it reminded me of high-school. Before I""d met him and began my life in darkness and hell. This... As I stopped my furious running around to get ready, my eyes were drawn out the window into the clear, sunny summer morning. This was... happiness? I""d forgotten what that felt like. Author""s Note: See what I did there? Starting the weave aspects of the other storylines into one. Yoosung""s getting a kitten, and Jumin being an asshole to poor Jaehee! (Seriously; Jaehee is such an adorable character. I love her.) Next time... Meeting Zen! Chapter Four Jagiya ""Patience is not sitting and waiting, it is foreseeing. It is looking at the thorn and seeing the rose, looking at the night and seeing the day. Lovers are patient and know that the moon needs time to become full."" - Jalauddin Rumi The cafe was quaint, run by a jolly old grandmother-type named Jangmi. I""d been here once, my first day in Korea, and it was just delightful. While waiting for Jumin""s driver, I ordered a chai tea latte and a little sweet croissant. The summer day was cool for once, the first glimpse of fall maybe, and the tea warmed me right up.",748687
2946,"Her eyelids were still heavy so she didn""t bother to open her eyes. She tried to remember what happened last night...waking up in her body again, rushing to see Yuuhi, Yuuhi kissing Aya, running away, being saved by a man when she was almost killed... She snapped her eyes open. She was surprised to see herself in an unfamiliar room. She examined the room with her eyes until she saw two people around. There was a young girl with short pink hair and an older man with black hair. ""Um...er...um...good morning?"" the young one said. Chidori sat up and smiled at her, ""Hello!"" ""She""s so cute..."" Chidori heard her say. The older one coughed and it caught Chidori""s attention. ""Um...hello! My name is Chidori Kurama."" The man smiled, ""I am Mitsukake."" ""What is your name? You""re such a cute little girl!"" Chidori asked the young one. Mitsukake started laughing. The young one pouted, ""I am not a girl...And my name is Chiriko."" ""I""m so sorry!"" Chidori apologized. ""You don""t need to, Chidori. Chiriko is always mistaken as girl,"" Mitsukake said after regaining his composure. His face was red from too much laughing. ""Um...why am I here?"" Chidori asked after a while. ""Hotohori said that he saved you from being hit by a truck."" ""Hotohori?"" ""Yes, he is my brother,"" Chiriko explained. Just then, a man with long hair entered. ""Brother!"" ""Hello, I see you are awake,"" Hotohori smiled at Chidori. Chidori could feel herself blushing. ""Tha..Thank you for saving me last night..."" ""Why did you do that?"" Mitsukake asked. ""It""s a long story..."" They sensed that Chidori don""t want to talk about it so they just fell silent. ""Breakfast is ready!!!"" a voice announced. ""Come now, Chidori! I""ll introduce you to everyone!"" Chiriko pulled Chidori""s hand. ""Now, Chiriko. Chidori is still weak and she needs to change her clothes,"" A woman entered. She has a long hair that was braided all the way down. ""Good morning, I am Chidori,"" Chidori introduced herself. ""I am Nuriko. Anyway, could you please go out while Chidori gets change?"" The guys went out leaving the 2 girls alone. ""I hope this is okay,"" Nuriko handed her a pink dress. She got changed. ""It looks nice on you,"" Nuriko surveyed Chidori. ""Thank you."" ""Anyway, let""s go down now,"" They exited the room.---------------------------------- Chidori was introduced to Tamahome and his wife Miaka. Chichiri, a monk, was also introduced. They had breakfast except for a man who walked out after seeing Chidori. ""Who is he?"" Chidori asked Miaka. ""He is Tasuki. He is such a brat so don""t mind him."" ""Chidori, do you like my cooking?"" Nuriko asked. ""It""s delicious."" ""Unlike someone there..."" Chichiri said. ""Are you talking about me?"" Veins began appearing at Miaka""s temple. ""Didn""t say any name..."" ""Chichiri!!!"" While Chichiri and Miaka started to fight, Chidori started to think about Yuuhi. She was currently eating mackerel, and that intensified the thought. ""Are you alright, Chidori?"" Hotohori asked. ""I am alright. Just thinking..."" ""You could stay here as long as you want.",560480
864,"Lion-O wanted to forget it, wanted to put it out of his mind, but every moment he wasn""t fighting, he remembered the sight of his brother kissing the woman he loved. The young king was tempted to get up and begin hacking away at trees again, but he knew it would be a pointless endeavor. Instead, he brought out the Sword of Omens and began to meditate with it, connect with it as the elephants had taught him. The sword was truly one with him, and Lion-O was learning how to fully wield it. With his meditation with it, it was beginning to speak with him. He closed his eyes and cleared his mind. It took longer than usual because of his emotional state, but just when he""d almost reached that point of zen, an unwelcome thought burst into his head. What if the Sword chose wrong? But instead of coming back to the real world, Lion-O found himself being thrown elsewhere. Or more accurately, it felt as though he""d made the connection with the Sword of Omens, and it was pulling him into itself. When Lion-O opened his eyes, he found himself in a place much like what the realm of Thundera once was. Though it was a little off, as there was a tension in the air, as if a threat was coming. It was the first time the Sword had ever done something like this, transported him to another time and place. It reminded Lion-O of his time in the Book of Omens. ""Are you really so surprised? We share similar names, should we not share other traits as well?"" Lion-O was stunned by the appearance of a companion. It was a silver, female ThunderCat. Long and lean, she had the sharpest teeth and claws he""d ever seen. ""Who are you?"" The other cat smiled, ""Do you really not know? I""m hurt, Lion-O. After all, I am a part of you."" Lion-O felt as though he""d stumbled into a dream. ""You""re the Sword of Omens."" The stunning cat smiled even wider, ""And the others doubt your intelligence."" ""Why are you like that?"" He motioned to her (its?) stunning figure. ""Oh, I can take any form I wish in here."" She deliberately posed in a manner that made her even more striking. ""It seemed the best way to get your attention, to be an attractive female."" Her red eyes glittered, ""A lesson Cheetara seems to know well."" Lion-O blushed and the Sword of Omens laughed. She threw an arm around his shoulders to comfort him, ""Don""t be embarrassed, child. I""ve seen much in my many years. Now come, think of me as your guide here."" Lion-O followed, but asked, ""Where are we?"" ""A plane of existence, much like the ones you""ve visited before, only this one is mine, so only the bearer of the Sword, or me, can enter here. By the way, only you can hear and see me though everyone else here sees you as the Lion-O of this realm."" Lion-O looked down, and saw that we was garbed in his old royal attire though he appeared he was also far more grown. He also noticed they were headed to the palace. ""Okay then. But why are we here?"" His guide smirked, as though she had a secret, ""To reassure you that I never choose wrong."" Lion-O was confused, and growing tired of his guide""s riddling answers.",1497577
2759,"I sometimes find her watching them intently from amidst the shadows, whatever her intentions are; somehow I seem a bit weary of what they could be. So much for the good old days of when sky pirating meant two people on a treasure hunt, adventure, romance, luxury! It doesn""t quite seem the same anymore, and I can""t quite recall the last time we found any good treasure on a hunt (that I didn""t have to split). Hopefully our little trip to the Lhusu Mines will at least prove entertaining, since I don""t hold that much hope for any sort of treasure or reward. Of course Larsa""s escape from the city of Rabanastre had been a success; in planning ahead, one can do many things that might not seem possible, particularly if the Empire""s guards a placed in every corner of the city. The great sky city of Bhujerba, as it sounds, the city was actually located in the sky. Larsa looked over the side of the bridge leading from the airship port to the city. The sights were absolutely marvelous, and he made a mental note to come back here if, indeed, he ever had time to relax and ""sight see"". Entering the mines was going to be dangerous, no two ways about it. By himself, he had known he probably wouldn""t be able to make it that far alone; yet standing just outside the building housing the lounge for those whom had come from the airships seemed to be the perfect place to start. Under the pretense of exploring the sights, he could quietly scout for a party which looked strong enough to take on the mines and possibly live long enough to still make it out alive. Most of the citizens here were either on vacation or some sort of personal reasons; the few here on business were the ones to look out for. Sometimes, hiding in plain sight was the best way to get the answers needed to continue on. Somewhat unexpectedly, Larsa found the party he had been looking for quite readily. He first heard the name of the Lhusu mines, the group having stopped near his location to talk about it. They mentioned something about monsters and rewards, more then likely being on some sort of hunt. Well, that means they probably wouldn""t mind a little extra help, if he didn""t ask for any of the physical rewards in the end. ""Are you headed to the Lhusu Mines, then?"" The men were tall, having an atmosphere of a mix of shady, ruggedly strong and greedy. Typical sky pirates, Larsa thought in the back of his mind. They stopped their conversation to look down at Larsa. They had to be tall... well, no matter. Height makes no difference in certain skills and scholarly knowledge. ""You have... business there, boy?"" One of the older men asked him. He looked dangerous, but another thing about the man had bothered Larsa. A certain look in his eyes... ""I do. I just need accompaniment into the mines; I have an errand to attend. I can help you out any way you need until our goals are complete. I""m quite good with alchemy and healing."" Larsa responded calmly, his manner straightforward. He didn""t necessarily hide things, but he didn""t straight up lie about it either. A balanced truth, to be sure.",583994
881,"""Like I""m going to listen to you,"" Jamila said as she launched herself off the ground and kicked him into a nearby cabin where some soldiers were. They took one glance at him and then to Jamila and then stood up with guns in their hands pointed at him. But from behind them came a man wearing black that turned out of course to be Ardeth. He disarmed them and knocked them out all in once which was a little fun to watch. ""Oh great an idiot and an old wind bag put together what ever am I going to do,"" Jamila said sarcastically acting as if she was cringing in fear and then laughed at what she had just said. ""The girl is not the one who you need now hand over the child and I will not hurt you Jamila,"" Ardeth said. ""Hurt me I doubt you could even prick me,"" Jamila said but then added onto it by saying, ""Besides I love the fighting and the adrenalin so why should I surrender when I can fight."" Jamila looked in Alex""s direction and felt their eyes catch again and she felt like she was drowning his he blue eyes once more. She swore she knew him from somewhere but didn""t know where and she was beginning to fret over it now and that was not good at all. She was caught off guard by Ardeth who swept his leg around her feet making her trip. ""You should stop staring and defend yourself like you said you would,"" Ardeth said with a smirk. Jamila looked at him with as much hate and rage she could muster up and said, "" Oh I will believe me at that."" Jamila said kicking her foot around hitting Alex in the jaw and then scraped Ardeth""s stomach, which still hurt. Alex got up with a bleeding lip but nothing much other than that. Jamila noticed how Imhotep, Anck-Su-Namun, and the child were gone probably trying to get far away from the fight. She then noticed Ardeth retreat to the top of the train with Alex behind him. Jamila soon followed and found her hair whipping around her face and she quickly pulled out a tie and tied it to keep it out of her face. She looked around for those two but could not find them but what she did find was the ground as she was kicked from behind. She tried to get up but found another blow to the stomach as someone kicked her while she was down. She managed to roll over and see that Rick O""Connell was the cause of all the kicks. She sneered at him and then remembered a curse she had read in the book and mumbled it and soon the sand that was around them built up around him pushing him away. She got up and looked around and soon found the opened hatch and then she saw Ardeth come out as well as the Alex kid with no one. She then noticed the guards coming to the top of the train as well as they shot at them. Jamila let her small sand storm slow down enough for Rick to retreat. She looked up and found what looked like a huge balloon overhead. She also found that it was picking them up and that everyone was firing at them. ""Stop we need them for later so don""t shoot damn it,"" Jamila yelled in Egyptian over the roaring wind as the train moved fast. Every soldier stopped and held his gun down as they disappeared over a huge mound of sand.",806976

Before any of the others could say anything else, Hotchner spoke up from behind me, ""He""s right. Morgan, Emily, I want you two to go and talk to the Doctor. Rossi and I will dig into the Christenson case some more to see if we can find anything."" ""I want to go too-"" Hotch cut me off abruptly, ""No, Reid.

I opened my mouth to protest, but he raised a hand to silence me, ""I know you are a doctor, Reid... but I""m sure we would all feel better if you got your hand looked at by a medical doctor."" I resigned and sighed, shaking my head silently. J.J. began to lead me down the corridor until Hotch stopped her, ""Wait, J.J."" ""Yeah, Hotch?"" ""Take him somewhere other then St. Mary""s."" Author""s Note: Reid might have seemed a little OOC in this chapter... but it""s not without reason.

I sighed as J.J.""s threat trailed off. There was nothing wrong with my hand, a fact I already knew from the moment it impacted the walls of the Las Vegas Police Department. Hotchner had order J.J. to take me to the hospital for no reason whatsoever, as it turned out. Precious time wasted on a doctor visit that could have been spent out finding the unsub. My rather abundant logical side knew that until Morgan and Emily finished interviewing Dr. Smith, we had no new leads, yet my more... emotional side just wanted to find the unsub and lead us straight to Nephilim. So many questions stirred around in my head, all compounded by my own intelligence bringing out even more. So many questions and not a single answer.

1427,"If she had been born two decades later, she might have had a chance to pursue Go professionally. While there was no outright discrimination against allowing female professionals into the leagues, the glass ceiling of the Go world had yet to be shattered. Women""s tournaments had difficulty finding sponsors, and most women professionals were viewed as weaker than their male counterparts. Akira thought it was shameful that his mother would never earn the respect she deserved as a player. Instead, she only revealed her brilliance at home, in the midst of his father""s study sessions. Akira knew his father was more open-minded than most in the Go world, and did what he could to make sure his wife was able to develop her skills. He always made sure his wife was included in study sessions, and never left her behind when he was invited to participate in Go events throughout the world. ""Your mother married me for my Go, and I married her for hers,"" he once told his son. ""She""s my best rival, no matter what others may think. Go, like marriage, is meant for two people."" But the unfairness of the situation really bothered Akira. If his mother had been born male, she would have so many more opportunities, instead of being forced to ride on her husband""s coattails. The study session wound down after another hour, and Akira felt himself relax as the last of his father""s students departed, leaving him alone with his parents. His father pulled out one of his thick cigars, ignoring his mother""s slight frown of disapproval as he lit it. ""So did you have a good day, boy?"" His father""s voice cracked from age, but his eyes were bright with cunning. Akira loved his father as a son should, but he didn""t always trust the old man. He""d ended up as the butt of his father""s twisted sense of humor one too many times to remain naïve. ""It was quite good,"" he said. ""I met with Hikaru at the salon, and we played several games."" ""Ah?"" His father raised an eyebrow. It had the effect of shifting his wrinkled skin in a less-than-appealing fashion. ""The boy still had no interest in joining the pro world?"" Akira shrugged. He himself had become a professional only out of a sense of duty to his father. He""d learned that not all the best games were fought in the pro world - all he had to do was think of his mother to know that. ""He""s content with playing against me,"" he said. ""And in the amateur tournaments."" ""It""s a waste of talent,"" his father snorted, before taking a drag on his cigar. ""You should invite him over sometime for a study session."" ""He won""t come,"" Akira replied. Shindou was notoriously shy of anything involving professional Go. His introduction to the pro world had been an encounter with an irate Ogata-senpai, so Akira didn""t blame him. ""Invite him for dinner,"" his mother said, her lips twitching with a slight smile. ""I would like to meet your friend."" Akira turned the thought over in his mind. ""He might come for food,"" he admitted after a second.",1112924
2614,"When that sensation of asphyxiation had finally passed and the pain had subsided, I started listening to myself, trying to evaluate what had happened. And I noticed that no matter how hard I tried, I couldn""t feel my own heartbeat. I knew it had to be there; after all, I wasn""t dead, but it took me a while to finally locate that faint beating in my chest. It was as if it was fading, and then I knew: it wasn""t me who was fading, it was him. Something happened. Something bad. He""s weak, and he""s helpless, and there""s very little hope left. And then I did something I""ve never done before: I reached down that strange metaphysical cord that seems to connect us and went looking not for him but for his companion. I went looking for Martha, the only person that could perhaps save him, and the world along with him. She was hard to find; she""s shielding against everything and everyone. She needs to be inconspicuous, remain out of sight, and I guess it didn""t help that she doesn""t have any friendly feelings towards me - me, the one she felt was standing between her and the Doctor. But even though I was having a hard time to accept her, nothing of that matters now. He needs her, and I will do what I can to help her. She needs strength to save him, and although she is strong already, I can perhaps make her even stronger. I don""t think she""ll notice my presence, and the connection is weak, but I try to reach her anyway, to somehow transmit all my determination, all my love for him, to her; everything that will add to her motivation and endurance.

3504,"Up ahead, right near the top of the building, the gigantic George seemed to be unaware that he was even be followed in the first place. All the better for him, Felix thought. His mind was so focused, so intent on saving his date. This was so different, Felix realized, despite the fact that this giant ape seemed to be following Ralph""s usual pattern: destroy something, move a bit, destroy something, and then move a bit more. The only difference was that this monster was faster than Ralph, and had a prize Felix could not afford to lose. When Felix did a regular day of his game, there was no thrill really, since he knew that it would usually end the same way. Most of the time, he""d come out victorious, or if the player was bad, the building would come down, but he""d fix it in a jiffy afterward. This time, however, there was actually something at stake. This time, Felix couldn""t just telegraph the outcome. But as he watched the ape finally make it to the top of the building, Felix and and his allies in hot pursuit, Felix knew that whatever the outcome, he would make sure with everything in his power that Sergeant Calhoun came out of this safe. Felix""s eyes narrowed as he, Beat and Ulala approached the roof. His big moment was almost upon him. When George finally stopped, he seemed almost bored all of a sudden, sitting down and taking in the view of the surrounding cityscape that had yet to be destroyed. Sergeant Calhoun could only wonder what his player was possibly up to, but these wandering thoughts were little compared to the problem at the present. She vaguely remembered Rampage, and that was through hearsay and the like. Hero""s Duty hadn""t been around for all that long, and in game terms, her self-contained universe was young and relatively ignorant to the accomplishments of all the various gaming legends that had come and gone in Litwak""s Arcade. But there was one thing she did remember, and that was the fact that in Rampage, the monsters didn""t just destroy buildings. They had a particular taste for people, and in her trapped state, she knew she was probably next on the menu. Though she would never admit it to a soul, a icy spike of fear cut right through her heart as she watched the monstrous ape bare his canines, looking down hungrily at his prize. As the monster""s maw opened, the blond-haired soldier could only wonder what her last words to Felix would possibly be, if he had been around to hear them. But perhaps she would still get that chance, because even Sergeant Calhoun couldn""t help but light up as she watched a blur speed right by George""s face, denying him his prize. There was a loud fizzing noise, and as Beat skidded to a stop, with Ulala quickly dismounting from him, the skater looked on in satisfaction at his handiwork. ""And that is how it""s done! Enjoy the taste of graffiti soul, King Kong."" he taunted as George used his free hand to claw at the white alien-shaped design now covering his face.",967934
1738,"He chuckled, ""Better clothes and accommodations at the very least."" ""Milord, I... I am sorry, but..."" My gaze dropped to Mother""s headstone. It would be a lie to say it wasn""t tempting, but... Leaving the farm would mean leaving her. Leaving the little shack by the desert woods, leaving behind the Eddars who had been so kind to us both... Tyrion followed my gaze and must have guessed my thoughts, for he clicked his tongue and said, ""I would pay the Eddars to clean and upkeep the grave and your little shack here. I would ask for a carriage from Lord Allyrion as well, since I doubt you would be comfortable riding for a month on horseback."" He eyed me, eyebrow raised, ""Have you ever ridden a horse?"" ""No, milord."" ""I suppose you could call me Father now, as well,"" The comment was flippant, but upon seeing the horror on my face he quickly added, ""Or not. But the ""milord"" business makes me a mite uncomfortable, coming from Tysha""s child. At least call me Tyrion."" ""Thank you, um... T-Tyrion,"" It felt weird to say, but at least it was better than ""Father"". ""Well, that settles it. Would you prefer to stay here before you and I leave in a week, or come with me back to Lord Allyrion""s castle?"" Tyrion smiled and walked around me, now between me and the dirt path to the farmhouse. ""I... I would stay here until then,"" Castles and Lords and all the extravagance that would bring was... frightening. Even the golden fist emblem of the Hand adorning Tyrion""s shirt was probably worth more than the whole tiny farm put together. And I needed some time to think. Tyrion only shrugged, ""That is fine. I""ll return each day to talk and get to know my bastard. Until then."" Then, with nothing more than an inclination of the head and a final look at my mother""s grave, Tyrion Lannister turned on his heel and walked with purpose back to the Eddars""s home. It took me a full five minutes to realize that I""d just been played. Technically, I""d never said I would go. But now I was in a bind. He""s weaseled a sort-of agreement out of me without me even realizing it. And now, I would be off for King""s Landing in a week""s time. Author""s Note: I had so much fun writing this chapter. I technically included stuff from the books, with the insinuation that Tyrion was forced to participate in Tysha""s assault and forced to pay with a gold coin, since that wasn""t stated in the show, but whatever. Also, it took math to figure out how old Synne should be, since in the books the whole thing with Tyrion and Tysha happened when he was thirteen whereas in the show he was sixteen (since most got aged up it seems). Oh well. Still had a lot of fun writing this. Yay, stories! And Jon will appear eventually, as well most of the cast I let survive, no worries. This is written before the series end, so when the last season or book comes out, some may be alive that weren""t in the book/show or visa versa, but whatever. My fanfic, my rules.

He lets me guide him out of the ballroom, into the school grounds and round the side of the building to a patch of green next to the parking lot. There is no one around. I sit down on one of the rocks that separate the grass from the parking lot and gesture for Donnie to sit beside me. He does. I reach for his hand again, lacing my fingers through his, and he holds it tight in his lap. His eyes are downcast, looking at our intertwined fingers. ""What is it?"" I ask again, impatience almost getting the better of me. ""I don""t understand, Donnie. I thought... I thought you..."" A lump rises in my throat. ""I do,"" he says, his voice very soft. ""You have no idea how much, April. I""ve loved you since the first day I saw you. At first I tried to hide it, and then we became friends and you started trusting me, and I didn""t want to put our friendship in danger, so I struggled to just come to terms with it and move on. But it goes too deep, you know. And it will probably be the only shot at love that I""ll ever have."" My heart breaks for him as I imagine what it must have been like for him. But that still doesn""t explain why he isn""t over the moon with happiness right now. ""Donnie,"" I say carefully, wrapping my other arm around his shoulder and leaning over so my forehead touches his temple. ""Why aren""t you happy, then? Didn""t I just tell you exactly what you""ve been hoping to hear? Why is it making you sad all of a sudden?"" He finally looks at me, and that unshed tear breaks loose and rolls down his cheek. ""Because you said it tonight,"" he says. ""And tonight, all bets are off. I""m not really myself tonight. How can I possibly believe anything that happens tonight will still be valid tomorrow, when I""m..."" He makes a vague gesture with his hand, and I finally understand. He is worried I""m only attracted to his human form tonight. He has it all so wrong. I stay silent for a moment, wondering how to explain it to him. ""Don""t you dare believe for just one second that I will no longer love you tomorrow,"" I say. It comes out angrier than I meant, but I realize that I actually am a little bit angry. ""Do you think I""m that shallow?"" ""No, of course not, but you""re human and I""m a turtle!"" Another tear falls. ""Doesn""t that weird you out?"" ""I""m not human, and you""re not a turtle,"" I snap back. ""At least not entirely. We""re both mutants. We""re probably more alike, genetically speaking, than an ordinary human and I would be. Just because I happen to look more like an ordinary human and you happen to look more, well, like a turtle doesn""t mean it""s weird. I""m not a human in love with a turtle. I""m a mutant in love with another mutant. X-Men isn""t weird, either!"" I may imagine things, but I do believe that some hope is returning to Donnie""s eyes. But he""s not convinced, not yet. The scientifically minded need proof.",240213
805,"Harrison tried to read what was going on in Sam""s head by staring into her eyes, but her eyes were dark, they refused to start up a connection with Harrison""s. ""You love me?"" Harrison gulped--- why in the world was she bringing up this situation? ""Yes"" Sam was shocked even more then the first time she heard those words out of Harrison""s mouth, how could he love her? How could he be so sure that he loved her so much? ""Why?"" Now it was Harrison""s turn to be shocked. Harrison finally lowered his eyes not knowing what to say, last time he had spilled his heart out to Sam she rejected it, what would make this time different? [Meanwhile back in the cafeteria] Brooke watched Harrison stomp out of the cafeteria with a sad expression on her face--- Harrison was her friend, a good friend, so when he was hurting she was hurting too. Over the past month Harrison and Brooke had grown close, they had got in touch with their old friendship and in the end Brooke had fallen for him, but his heart had belonged to another, his heart belonged to Sam. Brooke had saw the way Harrison looked at Sam, she remembered that she looked at Josh like that once, when she had loved him more then anything, that was how she knew Harrison""s feelings were true. It broke her heart everytime she saw the sad expression on his face whenever Sam would walk past him hand in hand with George--- Brooke wished that Sam felt the same way about Harrison that he felt for her, she wished that Sam could see how terrific Harrison was. Harrison loved Sam, it wasn""t a fluke, he really did love her, he loved her for all of her quirks, he loved her just the way she was--- his love was unconditional--- a love every girl wanted and unfortunately Sam didn""t know how deep Harrison""s love was--- Sam had no idea that when she wasn""t looking Harrison would watch her, admiring her and when she wasn""t watching there was love and adoration in his eyes--- and she had no idea. ""I""ve suddenly lost my appetite"" Brooke dropped her plastic fork down on her cafeteria tray. ""Me too"" Josh nodded at Carmen and Lily and rested his chin in between his hands--- the way things were going, things could only get better--- well hopefully. ""I just wish Sam would talk to me, she keeps avoiding me"" Nicole looked up from her recently purple colored fingernails, she stared at George as he continued to mope about Sam and how she was avoiding him and wasn""t telling him if she was okay or not, a huge, conniving smile spreaded across Nicole""s face, maybe things were looking up. If Nicole Julian loved anything more then herself--- it was love triangles and there was definitely love triangles going on here. Harrison loves Sam. Sam loves George. Mary Cherry loves Harrison. Brooke loves Harrison. How amusing was this? ""So amusing..."" Nicole muttered underneath her breath and continued to smirk as she thought of the possible outcomes of these various love triangles. [Outside of Kennedy High] ""Harrison, you still here with me?""",29783
2140,"""But they wouldn""t be very fashionable..."" Haymitch grabbed a bottle and headed for his room, leaving an enraged Effie in his wake. She yelled after him, ""I insist you wear that green outfit tomorrow, Haymitch."" Haymitch didn""t respond. The next morning Effie was trying to speak with the children, who were far more interested in the food. They favored the pancakes; she made a note to order more next year. Perhaps those tributes would like them as well. Effie continued to look to the door, eager to see how Haymitch would look when he wore something resembling real clothes. She had purchased him a green waist coat with tan puffy pants, hardly the most fashionable items, but she figured they remained within the rules the Mentor had set for her. When he did enter she nearly choked, before screeching, ""What are you wearing?"" Haymitch gave her a grin. ""Why nothing, princess. Is something wrong with your eyes?"" He came up close as if to examine them. She swatted him away while also trying to cover him up from the children""s eyes. They seemed both shocked, but completely unsure what to do. Effie dismissed them. They couldn""t leave fast enough. Effie then turned to Haymitch, who was now siting and eating a muffin. ""Haymitch, what are you doing?"" ""I""m eating. What is it with you and the obvious questions?"" He took a big bite from a muffin. Part of Effie was grateful that he was eating rather than drinking like usual, and noted the kind of muffin he was eating. She would be sure they were stocked next year for him. ""Why aren""t you wearing the clothes I sent you?"" ""Well, you see, princess,"" he crossed his legs and Effie averted her eyes, ""I don""t much care for puffy pants. I would really prefer no pants."" ""It""s completely inappropriate. Think of the children, think of the cameras, think of what people will say, Haymitch."" ""Well, I""m an embarrassment in my rags and I""m inappropriate in nothing according to you. I think this is all fine."" He took another big bite. ""So as I see it, this is your problem."" Effie wanted to slap him. Instead she stormed away and went to the communications car. She made a few phone calls so that Haymitch would have some clothes for the Games. She would never buy him puffy pants again. Haymitch dreamed of dead children. He dreamed of blood. He dreamed he was drowning in it. And he had forgotten how to swim. The girl had been the one to knock on Effie""s door. ""Miss Trinket?"" Effie looked at the time and threw on a robe and a wig; she didn""t have time to apply makeup though. She was pleased that the girl showed some matters by using her proper name, but was less pleased at the hour she was being called on. She opened the door only slightly, hoping the dim light would cover her uncovered face, ""Yes?"" The girl looked scared, after biting her lip, she said, ""Mr. Haymitch...I can""t sleep and neither can Cole."" That was when Effie heard him, yelling in his sleep. The noises didn""t seem to be coming from his room either. Effie normally slept with a mask and earplugs, which is why she didn""t hear him earlier.",1497577

All of the known Sectors have attended the tree house of Sector V as it is being televised and hosted by Nick and Chip.

Nick: Among the mourners for our fallen heroes is Alfred Yanky aka Weird Numbuh 27, Numbuh 101, ""The Kid"", Numbuh Eleventy Billion, Numbuh VO5, and even Supernatural specialist Edna Esmeralda Espinoza aka Numbuh 4444 has arrived on the scene. Chip: Not to mention even deceased have adult allies, there is Lasso Lass, Vin Moosk, Dr. Sigmund Teef, and Leaky Leona? Nick: Even Billy and Mandy have attended... but where is the Grim Reaper?

When he looked around, Mari was glaring at him, as she hid behind the still-smoking laser turret of her now-sand fort. ""Psycho woman."" Jin muttered, as he covered the smoking area with a lot of sand. ""Are all of your friends that scary?"" Jin did a double take. ""Scary?"" Jin didn""t bother hiding his snicker. ""Oh, man! Sorry, but you - the guy with horns and a claw - think they""re scary?"" Jin was now beside Dio, and wanting to get cozy with his almost-friend, slung a casual arm around the guy. ""Listen, what you should avoid are the girls. The red head there, her name""s Elesis. She""s a hot head so I""d advise you trying to cross her way when she""s mad."" He tilted his head to the group playing beach volleyball. ""The blond one is Lire, and she""s the mother of the group. Don""t be afraid to ask her anything, but I""m not sure why I can""t let my guard down around her."" Jin shook his head. ""The purple haired one is Arme. She""s funny and all, but she goes a little insane. Try to stay away as much as possible."" ""The pink-haired one is a childhood figure of mine. She""s Amy and she""s uh....violent. Especially when it concerns either Elesis or talks about her stardom. I""m sure you""ve heard of her since she does concerts everywhere."" Dio shook his head. ""No. First time I heard about her."" ""Wha?"" Jin looked shocked. ""We don""t have...entertainment in our continent."" Dio grunted, though he wasn""t hiding his head in his arms anymore. Jin grinned at his small observation. ""Archaemedia..."" Jin grunted. ""How""s Sir Victor?"" ""The old man?"" Dio perked up, looking interested that someone knew something about his continent. ""You know him?"" Jin smiled. ""He""s my perverted teacher. Enlightenment, my ass. He kept sexually harassing me every time we sparred. But he""s a good teacher...I guess..."" Jin shivered at the memory of it. Dio finally chuckled for once. ""So you were the kid he was talking about...the cute kid that he wanted me to meet at least once..."" ""Wow, really?"" Jin faced him, laughing. ""Coincidence, huh?"" Dio didn""t answer, but he was smiling fondly. ""Are those real horns?"" Jin""s eyes wandered towards the bluish horns protruding from his head. The other guy stiffened, and Jin felt the tension. ""I mean, they""re pretty cool."" Jin lightly punched him in the arm. ""It makes you look sexier I guess..."" Dio""s pointy ears, for his credit, were red up to the point. Jin looked thoughtful. ""I just said a guy was sexy."" Jin reflected. ""Oh well."" He laughed. Dio muttered something. ""Yeah?"" Jin wanted the guy to feel as much comfortable as possible, and he wanted to listen to what little he had to say. ""Y-you can touch them, if you want."" Dio shyly whispered. ""I-I really won""t mind."" Jin looked skeptical. ""W-well, it""s fine if you don""t want."" Dio looked defensive. ""I-it""s not as if I want you to - EEK!""",583064
1454,"A dove and a vulture are two different, but are they both not birds,"" Jamila""s voice rose. ""I can""t let this happen Jamila. This is my job to stop them, if I don""t I am betraying the medji,"" Alex replied, but knowing what she had said was true. They were no different. ""If you leave with me you are betraying the medji,"" Jamila yelled as she turned away from him. ""Keep your voice low someone might here you,"" Alex whispered harshly. Jamila took a deep breath and turned to him again. ""We are no different than them Amun,"" Jamila concluded. Alex stood there a moment and then finally sighed, ""I will not do anything as long as they leave peacefully and do not bring attention to themselves, but if their plan fails and they kill either another or themselves, then I have no choice, but to stop them...and you."" With his final words Alex forced himself to walk toward the door. He looked back to see her turn away from him and let sobs began to escape. He looked down and sighed as he opened the door and left. As he took his walk around the building he watched as the king began his way up to Jamila""s room to inform her about her betrothment, or punishment it seemed more like. Alex shook his head as he headed onto the other medji to grab a bite to eat before bed, but as he was heading that way the king quickly passed him again in a hurry as he made his way over toward the Priest""s temple. Alex didn""t follow even though something told him he should have. As he finally made it to the others he heard Princess Nefertiri scream for their help. Not hers but the king. As they rushed toward the temple they were met with the Pharoh""s dead body and Anck-su-namun. She gave one last desperate look back at Imhotep who was being dragged away before she turned back to the Medji. ""My body is no longer his temple,"" she cried as she took her dagger and plunged it into her body killing herself. Alex looked down at Jamila""s mother""s dead body and he felt the bile start to come up his throat. ""Come on let""s get them out of here and to the morgue,"" one of the soldiers said. ""Are you alright Amun? You don""t look so good,"" one of the medji asked. ""No I need to go get some air,"" Alex said quickly leaving the room and down the stairs to the outside. As he began to throw up he couldn""t help notice the person standing on the balcony. As he looked up he saw Jamila with a smile of triumph. She had wanted this to happen, and she must have sent the king to his death. Alex shook his head in disgust, but yet could he blame her? If he had been in her situation would he have done the same thing? He noticed that she looked down at him and frowned and then this begging look came over her face. He made his decision there and he turned his head away from her. When he looked back up finally she was gone and replaced by her sister as she made her way to Jamila""s room where he could now here her crying. Princess Nefertiri must have thought she was crying over her father and mother, but no, Alex knew whom she was crying for. She knew his terms and now he had to follow them.",806976

1061,"After a few more minutes, the Cercopes stopped outside a large rock, just as the landscape started to take a steep incline. Jason cocked his head up, and saw that they were at the base of what appeared to be a fairly large mountain. The forest was much denser there, so it was hard to tell. He turned back towards the group and saw that the two monkeys had gone over to the boulder and seemed to be pressing a combination of points on the rock. ""Of all the freaks to capture us,"" Leo said, coming over to stand next to Jason. ""I""m not sure this really constitutes being ""captured,'"" Jason pointed out. ""They don""t seem to be all that concerned with guarding us."" ""That""s just because they know that we have to come with them to get the others,"" Leo said angrily, kicking the ground with his sneaker. ""We""re doing such a great job on the quest,"" he said sarcastically. Jason was reminded of how Leo had been acting lately. Like he was to blame for what happened to Annabeth and Percy. ""Leo... that wasn""t your fault,"" Jason said, not quite sure why Leo would be blaming himself at all, but then they all felt a part of the blame at least for not getting there in time, or not paying close enough attention. ""You don""t know everything that happened,"" Leo said so quietly that Jason could barely hear. Jason was about to ask more, but the Cercopes began to speak. ""You will come with us."" They were standing in the same place that they had been, but now one face of the boulder was gone and in its place was a doorway which, as far as Jason could tell, led to a tunnel that went underneath the mountain. Jason and Leo glanced at each other. ""What have we got to lose?"" Jason asked. ""Our lives,"" Leo answered, but they both entered without any real hesitation. Soon, they were too far down the tunnel to see the sunlight coming in from the opening. The darkness was stuffy and suffocating. For a moment, Jason felt as though he couldn""t breathe. He ran his hand along the walls to keep from falling and considered asking Leo to light a small fire for them, but then decided that keeping that particular talent secret from their ""captors"" might be a good idea. Of course, Leo just reached into his tool belt and pulled out a flashlight, making Jason feel dumb. They continued for a few more minutes, before they reached what appeared to be a dead end. ""Great, now what?"" Leo asked, turning to the Cercopes. Not surprisingly, they ignored him. Instead, they tapped out another strange code and a crack of light appeared in the seemingly solid wall, and the Cercopes pushed it open. Jason blinked a few times to adjust his eyes to the cheery lighting in the room that they stepped into. The room was huge. It looked like a ballroom. Or a throne room. The walls were extravagantly decorated with gold wallpaper, thick hangings, and very intricate carvings and woodworking. The style was fancy enough to have swooped right out of the baroque era. It had the superfluous air of the Palace of Versailles (or so Jason assumed, he""d only ever seen the French palace in pictures).",2943978

Soon Alexandra shouts, ""NOOO! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? MY MANSION!"" Chowder Jr. replies, ""Sorry ""scary doll girl"" but I ate a marshmallow and this happened!"" Alexandra then says, ""Oh no, you discovered that marshmallows are a antidote to the spell."" Chowder Jr. grows back to normal size and as a result the doll mansion is wrecked. Alexandra is shocked at the sight but Courage Jr. is delighted and hugs Edna but noticed that Edna can""t move as she tells him, ""I think the spell turned me into a non-articulate plushie."" Chowder Jr. then sees Alexandra and picks her up while she panics and says, ""Ack! You big bully, go pick on someone your own size!"" Chowder Jr. then says, ""Ok you possessed toy, before I smash you into pieces so you will never perform another evil act ever again I have one question to ask... why""d you do it?"" Alexandra then tears up and says, ""I was a sickly young girl who never made friends in life so instead of using the dark magic my grandmother taught me for witchcraft purposes I mostly used them on making dolls which explains how lifelike they look, I only used the cookies on Edna, my best customer since not many people like macaroons, however I had a terrible terrible sickness and I was dying, I wanted to live a life with friends and not pass away before my time, so I transfered my soul into this doll I created into my likeness before my physical form fell to the sickness, and when Edna was with me my wish was fullfilled, but you two decide to come in and crush my dream and now you""re gonna crush me.""

Chowder Jr. then replies, ""I learned alot from mom, plus my dad dealt with supernatural stuff in the past... oh sorry I broke your doll mansion but I had no idea marshmallows reverse the curse."" Courage Jr. then has a idea and says to Alexandra, ""I got a idea to solve your loneliness problem AND help out a good friend... (And so...)

Shirley then sees Courage Jr. as a puppet pal and she asks him, ""Ok dog I have two questions, the first one is why did you call me at this late and why are you a doll?""",910821
296,"He gazed as her chest slowly rose and fell with her steady breaths, and he was so entranced that he jumped when he heard the dryer go off. He turned toward it, his brow furrowed as he stood up. ""Funny, I don""t remember putting anything in here..."" Josh opened the door and peered in, instantly recognizing the clothing as Lily""s. He chuckled to himself and looked over at the girl, who was still sound asleep. ""Well, she is asleep. I could just fold these for her!"" He scooped up all of the freshly cleaned articles and walked over to the open space, letting them fall to the ground. He sat cross-legged in the middle of the chaos, picking up the first shirt. Josh reached behind him for the last pieces, but they felt too... small. ""What the?..."" It was underwear. ""Oh, gross!"" Josh exclaimed, tossing it into the basket without bothering to fold it. He swiveled around to see the remaining pile, and it was all... feminine undergarments. Josh sighed and blew a puff of air. He""d rather go another round of OTG than do this. Just as he was picking up the next item, a voice from the shadows startled him. ""Josh, what the HELL are you doing?"" He looked up to see one angry Lily Gillan, looking as though she would gouge his eyes out any second. His face turned bright red. ""Uh... it""s not what it looks like! I was just being the nice friend that I am, taking care of your laundry so you wouldn""t have to wake up, and that just so happened to be with it!"" His hands flew around wildly as he tried to make his point. ""Whatever,"" Lily said, swiftly bending down and grabbing her things. Why hadn""t she berated him yet? He had invaded her privacy and touched all her clothes, which was not acceptable if you were Lily. No one touches her things. She shook her head to clear all thoughts of Josh and picked up her basket, leaning it on her hip. Lily started down the hall, but stopped and turned around halfway through. ""And Josh?"" she called. ""Yeah?"" His head poked out the door to the laundry room. ""Never let me catch you touching my things again."" I hate folding my laundry. :P Reviews are love! XX. Special thanks to Hana and Dave, you guys rock my socks! :) Guys, I""m sorry if it""s too fast. I. Can""t. Resist! I""m a hopeless romantic, after all... Josh watched Lily dance around out in the yard, hanging her clothes on a clothesline. After the whole laundry incident the week before, she refused to dry her laundry using the machines, and settled for the ""good old natural way,"" as she called it. Several people stared at her as they walked by, but she didn""t seem to be fazed by it. He admired her for that. ""Hey,"" Jim said to his son. Josh looked up from the window to see his father grinning at him. ""Uh, hey. How was work?"" Jim shrugged. ""Same old, same old. Taylor being Taylor. Nothing special."" Suddenly he turned businesslike. ""Enough about his, how""s you and Lily?"" ""I don""t know what you""re talking about,"" Josh said flatly, returning his gaze back outside. ""You may be able to hide it from the others, but not me. I""m trained to notice everything, remember?""",2855986
2902,"Instead, he turned suddenly, pushing Satine behind him, so her back pressed against the wall that surrounded the town. He stood between her and the ever-growing throng people that surrounded them. Now would be a good time to have a lightsaber, he thought wryly. Although for the most part, the townspeople appeared to be nothing more than simple villagers, he had learned long ago that you could never count out a Mandalorian regardless of their station. Almost all had been trained in combat since birth, meaning a farmer could be just as deadly as an assassin or bounty hunter, and more than a match for an unarmed jedi padawan and a pacifist duchess. The crowd was pressing in on them, led by the man who had first recognized Satine. ""We live in hell, mhi cuye o""r dar""yaim, while this hut""uunla Duchess, this dar""manda, runs away and conspires with the Jetiise!"" ""Stay back,"" Obi-Wan warned. The crowd didn""t listen, just pressed forward. He took a step backwards. ""I say we give her over to the bounty hunters-split the reward,"" the second man added. ""Gra""tua par Mandalore!"" Soon the cry carried through the crowd. ""Gra""tua par Mandalore! Gra""tua par Mandalore!"" ""I""m guessing they""re not surrendering,"" Obi-Wan whispered drily to Satine, taking another step back, so he was practically on top of her. With no more room for him to retreat, the crowd finally halted. They were completely surrounded-if he reached out a hand, he could practically brush the chest of the leader. Satine didn""t respond; she was too busy staring into the mob. Obi-Wan followed her gaze, and saw that the old woman from the booth had joined the crowd. Though he wasn""t exactly surprised, he could practically feel the sadness and weariness rolling off the Duchess. ""Don""t come any closer,"" Obi-Wan said, addressing the man in front in particular. ""I don""t want to hurt you."" The man laughed derisively. ""Arrogant little Jetii."" He took a step forward, so he and Obi-Wan were mere inches apart. ""I will crush you."" The man raised his fists and Obi-Wan raised his own hands, ready to force-push him back. ""STOP!"" Ridiculously, Satine""s cry was so unexpected it actually worked-both Obi-Wan and the man turned to her in surprise. Before he was completely cognizant of what was happening, she had slipped under Obi-Wan""s raised arms and pushed him back, so he was pressed against the wall and she stood unprotected before the mob of angry Mandalorians. His shock was matched by the man he had been about to fight, who, somewhat ironically, looked unsure of how to proceed, now that the exact thing he wanted was standing before him. The Duchess however exhibited none of his hesitation. Looking to the crowd, she calmly removed her hood. ""I am Satine Kryze of Clan Kryze, Duchess of Mandalore."" She paused a moment before continuing. ""I beg you to let us go without violence."" ""What are you doing?"" Obi-Wan whispered fiercely, trying to maneuver around her. She pushed him back with surprising force. ""Let me handle this, Obi,"" she whispered back. ""Not all of us have forgotten our heritage.""",2943978
3250,"He was always so busy chasing after Brooke that he hadn""t realized that the girl of his dreams was right under his nose the whole time and she had been Sam McPherson and when he finally did, she had found someone else. George Austin, *god what does she see in him? * George was everything Sam despised, she hated jocks, she liked the original type of guys, you know the type that came up with creative ideas... guys like him--- but yet he wasn""t what she wanted, he was and that was killing him inside slowly. ""Hey Harrison"" Harrison pulled himself away from his thoughts when he heard Sam""s voice enter his ears, Harrison turned around to see that Brooke and Sam were already in the backseat of the car and Josh was re-starting the car, getting ready to take off. ""Hey Sammy, do you feel better?"" Sam opened her mouth to respond to Harrison""s thoughtful question but shut her mouth suddenly when she heard the melody of the song that had just started playing on the radio. Sam turned to Brooke and smiled. ""Oh my god, I love this song turn it up"" Josh looked at Sam oddly but then turned it up and then smirked as he recogonized the song, Harrison leaned back in the car seat as he also recogonized the song. ""Journey down memory lane..."" Brooke and Sam nodded at Harrison""s comment. *start of flashback* ""Okay so me and Brooke are the lead singers and you two---"" An 8 yr. old Sam who had her brown hair in braided pig-tails pointed to Harrison and Josh. ""Are our back-up singers, and don""t even ask why"" Harrison nodded and held on tight to the the hairbrush as Josh held on to the stick; Brooke and Sam held on to their big wooden spoons, they whipped their heads back as the song began, they listened to the rythm for a second and then began singing to it. ""Oh Why you look so sad tears are in your eyes Come on and come to me, now Don""t Be ashamed to cry Let me see you through Cause I""ve seen the dark side, too When the night falls on you You don""t know what to do Nothing you confess Could make me love you less I""ll stand by you I""ll stand by you Won""t let nobody hurt you I""ll stand by you So If you""re mad, get mad don""t hold it all inside come on and talk to me now Hey what you got to hide I get angry too, Well, I""m allowed, like you When you""re standing at the crossroads And don""t know which path to choose Let me come along Cause even if you""re wrong I""ll stand by you I""ll stand by you Won""t let nobody hurt you I""ll stand by you Take me in into your darkest hour And I""ll never desert you I""ll stand by you.",29783
1940,"And I thought we were going to be here all week. Three cheers for the robot!"" Randy exclaimed. Craven was not amused by his joke, as usual. ""Hmmm...this looks interesting."" Elsie said as she gave the fragment a quick look, ""Whatever this belongs to, one things for sure; it""s definitely an invertebrate. I""ll do some analysis on this exoskeleton sample and see what else I can discover about this creature. Nice work, Craven."" The scientist couldn""t help but blush at the compliment, much to Randy""s amusement, ""Oh...thanks. It was nothing really..."" ""So I""m guessing now""s when we call the G-Man and have him smoke the oversized creepy crawly ?"" Randy wondered, but his attempt to be upbeat didn""t phase past Dr. Tatopoulos. ""We don""t know enough about this creature to go after it yet. Our best bet right now is to sit tight and wait for it to make another appearance. If we can catch it red-handed, we might be able to subdue it before it can cause anymore significant damage. For now, I""m going to hold off on calling Godzilla."" Nick replied, but his response to Randy""s statement seemed to blow a fuse in Monique. ""I detest agreeing with Randy, but he has a point. We find the creature now and strike when it is caught off-guard. It could only be a matter of time before it develops an appetite beyond livestock."" she stated, hoping that her sensibilities would actually pierce the American doctor""s mind for once. ""Attacking blindly will just jeopardize the situation further. Let""s just get back to the Heat-Seeker and call it a day. If the creature appears again tonight, then we""ll think about calling Godzilla. Until then, I think some of us are in need of some downtime."" As Dr. Tatopoulos finished, the French agent crossed her arms. She couldn""t help but feel disappointed in his decision, as per usual. Randy noticed her bad mood almost immediately, and gave her a thumbs up and a grin in an attempt to cheer her up. Monique didn""t want to give him the satisfaction of thinking he had any effect on her, but even her cold-heated demeanor couldn""t completely resist that attitude of his. Still, she couldn""t ignore what Dr. Tatopoulos was suggesting. ""Some of us need this so-called downtime,"" Monique said under her breath, ""I am not one such person, doctor."" It was at a time like this, when the Heat-Seeker wouldn""t stop rocking back and forth, that Randy wished Nick had arranged for them to stay in a nice hotel. Between the ship""s constant movement, the strange smell that seemed to emanating for the waters of the Mississippi River, and Craven""s snoring just a cabin away, Randy didn""t expect to get a lot of sleep tonight. As he tossed and turned in the cot, Randy""s mind jumped from topic to topic, eventually stopping on the most popular one; Monique. The hacker still didn""t know if he playing the game of love right with her, especially considering how she treated him most of the time. Still, he definitely didn""t imagine that kiss back when they were dealing with Maximillian Spiel and his monster battle royale. So there was still hope.",967934
1270,"A pony-tailed novice came up to him. Byakko took a second look to see he was male. ""You""re new here?"" Byakko asked his classman. ""Yeah, came from Morroc for training. I""m ShadowEyes."" The boy extended his hand in a gesture of shaking. ""It""s a wonder you didn""t laugh. I""m Byakko..."" Returning back the handshake, he looked on across the fields eyeing a Rhoda Frog that was croaking noisily on the meadow. ""And why would people laugh at you?"" Shadow Eyes asked, his curiosity was suddenly piqued. ""10 Strength, 20 Agility, 15 Vitality, 10 Intelligence, 10 Dexterity, 1 Luck. Who wouldn""t laugh at that?"" Byakko flinched when he noticed ShadowEyes restrained a laugh from coming out of his mouth. ""Mphf!"" ShadowEyes finally settled. ""You should realize that you""re a..."" ""Hybrid? Yes, I know that...I""m going to be a battle acolyte...""Byakko cut in as he noticed the other boy was now rolling across the meadow, his hand clutching his stomach as the other laughed like there was no tomorrow. ""Oh that was rich! For a minute there, I thought you said you were going to be a battle acolyte! Heh that would be just the same as a battle mage!"" ShadowEyes snickered, settling once again after the hard round of laughing. ""I was, and a battle mage is more specifically called a ""Sage"". And I don""t get it why people would look at hybrids and out of the way builds like we are homosexual or something..."" Byakko was now irritated, rising up from his sitting position and began slamming the Rhoda Frog until the spawn came out. ""Then why didn""t you plan to be just a swordsman? You could use your strength there, and your vitality is just as good..."" ShadowEyes joined the silver haired Byakko as he brandished his 7 Main Gauche against a Poring that tried to loot the Spawn. ""Because...I...promised...a...priest...I will...become...one..."" Byakko said in between intervals as he continuously bashed 5 Porings that tried mobbing him. An Unripe Apple fell, much to his delight. The other novices tried getting their hands on it, but Byakko got it first. ""You wish!!! Thank god to the anti-looting system!"" Byakko kissed the fifth Unripe Apple that day, as he waved his fists at the would-be looters. ""By the way, what""s your level, ShadowEyes?"" Byakko looked back at the semi-envious boy. ""Just 12/9."" ""Hmm, I""m already 17/10. Want to take on a Rocker? I""ll let you join me..."" Byakko decided to walk the distance to the Rocker Fields. ""Nah, it""s okay. I""ll walk it back to Morroc. By the time I get home, I""ll be ready to become a thief."" His pride kicked in, seeing the higher leveled boy. ""I""ll come along. My quest is to find Mother Matilda, they said she hangs out at Morroc..."" Byakko said, packing extra supplies on his backpack. ""Fine, just don""t kill steal from me..."" ShadowEyes said smugly, going back to the streets of Prontera to buy himself a new knife when he would reach his desired job. Byakko just looked on at his 12,000 zennys in his pocket as he wished for the Chain that he saw the other day at the Sanctuary.",583064
1916,"The only time she released her guard, when they both did. In this short time between the early and late morning times, for just a little while, they pretended. They pretended that their reality wasn""t about the war, territory expansion, killing and betrayals. The world was what they imagined it to be, something they desperately wanted to cling on to; reminiscent of the past. Maybe, just maybe if they pretended hard enough, Yuuri might even be able to walk through the door to greet them like he always had. The atmosphere was thick with lies and fake, giddy emotions. Obeying the crown was a sinister crimeHis soul was tortured by loss and by pain - the oath made him stay It happened on that day, what now seems like such a long, long time ago. The day Wolfram""s entire world broke down into minuscule, irrecoverable pieces. That day, right after that fateful battle which made even the fates hold their breath. Near that burnt down mansion, in the field which felt like nothing more than an open grave... He""s torn between his honor and the true love of his lifeHe prayed for both but was denied Wolfram""s voice screamed in agony, the words inaudible and unimportant. The dead grass hurt his body as he pulled himself along the ground towards Elizabeth""s body. Deep in his heart, he already knew the truth behind what had happened. Yuuri and Murata were gone when he woke up. The warm hand that he fell asleep with left a horrible feeling behind on the wind. His kimono was torn and barely covering him, his chest full of grass stains and superficial cuts from the dead grass blades. Behind all of Yuuri""s nice words, and the motivation behind his actions, everything had been nothing more than a lie. ""You... lied to me, Yuuri! YOU FUCKING BASTARD!"" Tears ran a line down his dust and slightly ashy face. His eyes focused on nothing but Elizabeth, but his mind found nothing but Yuuri. ""You said... you would die with me. But I""m still alive, aren""t I? This world is... too much to bear alone... Yuuri... I love you. I swear, now, even if you don""t like it, I will join you in the stars above me."" The loud rustling sounded that came from the forest made his heart skip in shock. Immediately he pulled on a calm, resigned face when he gazed upon the arriving party. ""It""s you. You""re still alive?"" The she-wolf walked gracefully across the field. Her voice was smooth and seductive; although she seemed less powerful than before, the sheer fact of dread emanated faithfully remained. ""I know you, I do."" The wolf""s voice seem to have a duel tone to it when she spoke, ""If you want to die, truly die, then I can do something better for you. You will thank me for it."" ""What would that be?"" he knew this was trouble, the wolf was dangerous. She""s the being that controlled Elizabeth, his ""rival"" in love and master torturer. Pushed to the edge of reason, his common sense was being manipulated masterfully. ""You""re evil, why should I listen to you? I""ll only get myself into deeper trouble."" The wolf trotted closer, the soft black fur wisped by his skin.",583994
7,"With that, Lars gave them the middle finger as a way of defending himself, his friends and his heritage and Jesse knew that this was far from over and as he walks out, Marcus went over to Lars and said, ""Don""t worry, Lars. We got your back."" ""Gracias, mi amigos."" Didn""t expect that coming from me, huh? Well, we got more coming up! Admist all the drama, we begin to get to know a little more about Lars. Chapter 6: Getting to Know Lars At lunchtime, Lars walked across the cafeteria and when he saw Jojo and some of his friends sitting at the table, he was eager to join them. And in a twist, Diego saw him coming by and he said, ""Lars, there""s a seat right here, man."" Lars quickly went over to the table and when he sat down, he saw some more of Jojo""s friends and he said, ""Hey, I see we got more friends."" ""Yep. Lars, these are our friends; Caitlyn, Misty, Chad, Stephen, Dustin, Josh, Hoagie, Noah and Brutus."" Jojo said, as he introduced them. ""Hola."" Lars said. Josh widened his eyes as he heard Lars"" accent come out and he asked, ""Where ya from?"" ""Originally from Puebla, Mexico, but I live in Whoville now."" Lars replied. Misty was completely blown away by the fact that he""s from Mexico and she said, ""That is amazing! I always wanted to meet an actual Mexican."" Lars lets out a small chuckle after hearing this compliment and he said, ""Thank you. I""ve been here for a week now and it started off really tough. I don""t know why several students here don""t like me, saying that I don""t belong here."" Most of them were shocked to hear this and Noah asked, ""What do you mean?"" ""Some people in this school were assuming that I""m here illegally or that I""m starting a drug war with my family and that""s not true. They""re just assuming these things based on what you read or see in the news, but not all Mexicans are like that. We""re really just trying to live our own lives and hopefully, show that we""re good people like everyone else."" Lars explained. Hoagie took a sip of his soda and he said, ""Oh, yeah...you""re that kid I saw introducing yourself to my class on the first day you came here. I never got a chance to meet you because some random students were staring up stupid rumors about you. I""m not really one to judge other people based on who they are that quickly or what they look like. I get along with mostly everyone."" ""That""s cool."" Lars added. ""So...what do we want to know about you, Lars?"" asked Zeke. Lars clears his throat and he said, ""I learned how to speak English before I came here to Whoville since I was like...6 or something. I always speak spanish, but I had a hard time understanding English so I went to several English classes in Mexico and I sorta caught on a little bit. My family...we love to make mexican food and also mexican music. My mom""s like...excellent at making salsa, burritos, tortillas, quesadillas...every single mexican food you could think of, she makes. And my papi...he""s an excellent musician; plays guitar, maracas and samba."" They were amazed at how much knowledge about Mexican life and Jojo said, ""That sounds incredible.",1276465
2686,"Like a song of love that clings to him...how the thought of you...does things to him. Never before...has someone been more...unforgettable...in every way."" TK sang in a low voice, hoping this was as obvious as he had to be. Unfortunately, he failed to see Shiina""s expression of disbelief, and Matsushita""s face, which was turning bright red. At the same time, Iwasawa""s eyes widened, and she stood up, fully taking in what TK had just told him. Her eyes failed to focus on Matsushita. This was all very sudden to her. Iwasawa had always been told she was popular among the student body. Hisako made that clear. However, she had always thought it was only because of her being the lead portion of their band, Girls Dead Monster. She had never imagined a boy feeling...that way about her. All her friends had always been girls, and she thought it would have always stayed that way. ""Well...that""s interesting. I don""t really know what to say though..."" Iwasawa replied, delivering the dreaded answer that Matsushita had hoped he would never hear. TK was speechless now. Shiina remained silent, knowing that the time to act against TK would be soon. Matsushita 5th Dan""s business was none of her""s however. Something inside Matsushita 5th Dan erupted at that moment. His face became sincere, and he pushed past TK. There were no thoughts of judo or of gyūdon in his head right now. No...all he could think of was the beautiful guitarist in front of him and what he was about to ask her. He had decided for himself at this time that he would not lose like this. TK wasn""t going to be there forever. He couldn""t depend on him for everything. Hisako had been right. If he was the right guy for Iwasawa...then there was no chance of failure. ""I""m done with letting him talk for me. I have something to ask you, Iwasawa-san. Something I didn""t think I""d be able to ask you for a long time."" The guitarist was still feeling a little awkward about TK""s words, but from the look on Matsushita""s face, she decided to hear him out. ""Alright..."" ""I...I have always loved your music. Ever since the beginning of the year...when I overhead one of your CD""s with TK, I couldn""t stop thinking about your music. I listened to it every single day, and I still do. In fact...I listen to it during judo training. It helps me focus."" Iwasawa could feel herself calming down as she listened to Matsushita""s words. She knew him only by name, and he had never really stuck out to her much. But now was a little different. He seemed...interesting, all of a sudden. ""I always wanted to know the singer. She sounded so talented. She sang like an angel. I couldn""t help but think about what she was like. I wanted to meet her. I really wanted to just get to know her."" Matsushita continued, his voice becoming more confident with each word. Strangely, this all seemed to come out naturally. He had never imagined being able to say things like this to anyone, let alone a girl. Beside him, TK remained silent, but with a grin on his face. Shiina pretended to look like she wasn""t listening, when in fact she was.",967934
2513,"Doc, you were standing on your toilet, you were hanging a clock-"" ""-And you fell and hit your head on the sink-"" ""-And that""s when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor-"" ""-Which is what makes time travel possible!"" they both finished. They stood there for few seconds, panting. The garage door opened once again to reveal Doc, his brown eyes wide with astonishment. ""There was something wrong with the starter,"" Marty said as they drove up to Lyon Estates in Doc""s white Packard. ""So we hid it here."" They got out and carefully brushed away the tree branches concealing the DeLorean. Doc stared at it. ""After I fell off my toilet,"" he began, ""I drew this."" He held up a pice of copy paper with a hasty drawing of the upside-down peace sign. A couple of equations had been scrawled next to it. ""The flux capacitor,"" Marty murmured. He opened the door and flicked on the real thing. He pointed and grinned in a sort of grim way. Doc fell on his knees, staring at the thing. For a second Elle thought he might faint. ""It works!"" he yelled into the night. ""I""ve invented something that works!"" he said, grabbing Elle""s collar in excitement. ""You bet your ass it works,"" Elle whispered. ""We""ve got to find a way to sneak this back to my laboratory."" He clutched her tighter. ""We""ve got to get you home!"" So here is Chapter 5. I""ve wondered just how much of Elle""s thoughts I should include, and it was something I totally slaved over for three days. It""s quite hard to write about something you can""t really relate to. I""ve never been in love with my best friend, so I had to imagine what it would be like. I""m still not sure if I got it right, though. Quick note on the title change: Stupid, Stupid is this song I""ve been fangirling over for a few days. Essentially it""s about this couple who has dumb fights all the time and they call each other ""stupid""... but they still love each other :-) I thought it summed up Marty and Elle""s relationship in a nutshell. It""s by Alex Day, if you""re interested. ""Marty, are you sure you know what you""re doing?"" Elle smirked, watching Marty fiddle with the TV. He was trying to hook up the footage from the video camera to Doc""s TV. ""Of course I""m sure. I""m a guy, guys know about these kind of things,"" Marty reassured her. ""Just sit back and watch the master."" A couple of sparks flew out of the back of the TV and Marty pulled his hand back. ""Ow!"" ""What""s wrong?"" ""Damn thing shocked me."" ""...Do you need any help now?"" Marty looked at her and gave a resigned sigh. He nodded. Elle leapt up from her perch on the couch. ""Move,"" she elbowed him out of the way and took a look at the wires in the back. ""So what don""t you get? ""See, I""m not sure which wire goes where. If you put the wire here, the image is a little fuzzy..."" Marty crossed a wire to another. Elle leaned over and looked at the screen. ""I see it,"" she said before ducking back behind it again. ""But if you put it here-"" Marty crossed it again- ""Everything-"" ""-becomes clear,"" she finished with him. She looked at him.",2855986
3266,"""Neither do I!"" cried RJ. ""Man, how long has it been, 7 years?"" ""I don""t know. I completely lost track of time."" They both laughed hysterically and Mookie said, ""How did you find me? I was sleeping in that tree over there."" ""Well, I heard a noise last night and I wanted to check it out. When I saw you, I felt that you needed to sleep with a family. So, I thought that was you. I guess I didn""t realize it until just now."" said RJ. Mookie chuckles and said, ""I wish I could say the same. My mom died yesterday."" RJ put his hand on his shoulder and said, ""I""m sorry. I didn""t know."" ""Me neither. I""m almost 13 and I""m afraid to celebrate my 13th birthday with no one around. It""s gonna be really lonely when it""s just me."" said Mookie. RJ thought about it and then thought, ""I""m not gonna let you spend it alone. We""re gonna make you a part of our family."" ""We?"" asked Mookie. Chapter 2: Meeting Mookie The other animals got up and RJ walked across the forest along with Mookie. Heather looked at RJ and said, ""Who""s that raccoon walking towards RJ?"" Ozzie looked at him and said in shock, ""There are two raccoons. One""s gonna spare us! We""re doomed! Adieu! Adieu! Parting is such sweet sorrow."" Heather groaned embarrassedly and said, ""Dad, when for once in your life, please just shut up? It""s not the end of the world, you know."" ""He""s not a predator?"" asked Ozzie, worriedly. ""Maybe if we could meet him, he would be less dangerous."" said Heather. ""You""re right."" When RJ and Mookie arrived, the animals were surprised that RJ has a twin brother. Hammy looked at them and said, ""There are 2 RJ""s. What if one""s soft and cuddly? Kinda like a rabbit? I don""t know. Let""s just find out!"" ""Okay, what is his problem?"" asked Mookie. ""He""s hyper. We get used to it."" said RJ. ""Oooookay. Weird."" RJ clears his throat and said, ""Everyone, this is my long-lost brother, Mookie. Mook, this is Stella, Tiger, Lou, Penny, Bucky, Quillow, Spike, Heather, Ozzie, Hammy and the one holding a stick is Verne."" Mookie waved to everyone and said, ""Hi, guys. What""s up?"" Stella looked at him and said, ""I didn""t know you""re RJ""s brother. Nice to meet you. How old are you?"" ""I""m 12. About to be 13 in a few days."" said Mookie. ""Looking all grown up, ain""t you?"" asked Stella. ""Kinda."" Heather came to Mookie and said, ""Nice to meet you."" ""Thanks. You look like a very pretty girl."" Heather giggled and said, ""Thank you. You look very cute and funny."" ""Thanks so much."" Ozzie walked past Heather and Mookie and said, ""My daughter is not dating anyone for a while."" Mookie scoffed and said, ""Who said anything about dating her? I wouldn""t fall in love with someone I just met."" ""Yeah, you got a point. Nice to meet you, by the way."" ""You too. Just cut out the melodrama for a while."" ""He""s always like that, so I""m used to it."" said RJ. Hammy flew at him and asked, ""Are you a rabbit?"" ""No. I""m a raccoon."" ""Really? You don""t like anything alike."" said Penny. ""We""re fraternal twins. We look alike, but we""re different, really. RJ has blue eyes and mine are red.",1276465
2163,"What has the kid done to you?"" ""Nothing."" ""Has he disrespected you, hurt you?"" asked Ozzie. ""No."" ""Did he say or do anything negative to you?"" asked Stella. ""No."" ""Has he been violent to you?"" asked Heather. ""No."" ""Well, I think I made my point. He""s done nothing to you. All he wanted was a little family and love. You""re just too shallow and hard to break to give it to a kid who has nothing, but more than what he""s gonna have."" said RJ. ""Let""s go find him. He""s like a teddy bear that everyone can hold on to and snuggle him up."" said Tiger. ""Good point."" said Stella. All the other animals walked out and searched for Mookie. RJ turned to Verne and said, ""Why did you send him out when you know he has nowhere else to go?"" ""It""s best for everyone, RJ."" said Verne. ""Best for everyone or best for you?"" RJ walked away leaving Verne feeling a little guilty about kicking Mookie out of the family. He realizes that he""s been very sweet, kind and gentle in need of a family. Chapter 8: Returning Home The animals went around the road looking for Mookie. They ran across the park searching towards the playground and the trees. RJ said, ""Any luck?"" ""No, he""s not in the slide."" said Ozzie. ""We checked the swings and he""s not there."" said Lou. ""He""s not under the teeter-totter, either."" said Stella. ""Oh, man. This is getting frustrating. He could be anywhere by now."" said RJ. ""You won""t find him."" The animals looked up and saw Verne standing in front of him and then said, ""Not without me. You need a leader to find a kid who looks like RJ."" RJ smiled and said, ""I knew you came to your senses."" The animals continued to look around and search for Mookie until they heard a guitar playing. Heather walked around wondering where the sound is coming from. The others followed her and it ended up under the picnic table. Heather looked under the table and she saw Mookie. He stopped playing, then looked up and saw Heather standing here. ""What are you doing here?"" asked Mookie. ""We""re looking for you."" said Heather. Verne walked towards Mookie and said, ""What do you want? Are you gonna say anything negative about me?"" ""No. I just came to tell you that I""m sorry about all the stuff I said. The day before, I was misunderstood by your feelings. Yesterday, I was out of line. I was just jealous about everyone giving you your attention and helping yu out with your time of need. For that, I hope you""ll forgive me."" said Verne. Mookie smiled and said, ""Come here."" Verne came close to him and gave him a big hug. Mookie asked, ""So, are we cool?"" ""Yeah, we""re cool."" The animals cheered excitedly and RJ said, ""I""m glad that everything worked out pretty well."" ""My daughter really likes you as a little brother."" said Ozzie. Mookie looked at Heather and said, ""It""s true. So, I see today""s your 13th."" ""It feels like it."" ""Come on, everyone. Let""s go home."" said Verne. The animals went out of the park and walked back home to the hedge along with Mookie..., where he seriously belongs.",1276465
2599,"Tomorrow you will eat from the golden apple and live with me as my queen."" He brushed his knuckles over her cheek and sighed as she tore herself from him. ""I would kill myself having to live so long with you."" He firmly gripped her shoulders with a powerful grip and nibbled on her lobe. ""Oh really? Well that""s not so nice considering how I care for you."" He hissed into her ear sending shivers down her body, she squeezed her eyes tightly. Maybe benefiting from this wasn""t exactly a smart idea, she had grown in love with Loki... But she needed her magic back, it was all she wanted out of life, emptiness that""s what it felt like, as if Loki had carved her inside out. ""I just want it back."" ""You would leave and I can""t allow that."" He taunted, pressing a kiss behind her ear. ""I""m dearly in love with you."" She shoved him back and swung her legs over the edge of the bed. ""I am not in love with you... I-I don""t know how many times I have to tell you that."" He sat up on his elbow facing her still. ""You seemed intent on saying I love you to me every time I was in your graces earlier."" ""I want my magic back."" She couldn""t contain herself, tears threatened to spill down her cheeks, she covered her face with her palms feeling tantalizing fingers caress her spine. ""If you make love to me, then I will determine if you are worthy of taking it back."" She glanced over her shoulder at him, she hadn""t done anything intimate with him since she arrived and he didn""t force her. ""What does sex have anything to do with it."" She spat at him, he chuckled laying onto his back and staring up at the ceiling with a smirk. ""It proves your adoration for me. If it""s a lie then I will know you will not be fit for getting your magic back. That I cannot trust you."" ""How smooth of you my king."" She sarcastically replied, twisting her body to glare at him easily. ""I am not fucking you-"" ""Making love."" He corrected, she blushed profusely, averting her eyes away. ""I will wait for you to make a decision. This is the last chance you have at getting your magic. Take that into consideration."" He didn""t seem to bother her as she stop up and began to pace, his eyes closed as if he was asleep, but he certainly was wide awake. The hint of a simpler written on his expression as he heard her patting feet move back and forth. She wasn""t sure how much she wanted this, how much she wanted him. Her love for him was... She didn""t know what love even was. Here he offered immortality, here he offered her care, and genuine love. How could she react to that stubbornly? She loved him. She kept lying to herself, saying it was only for her magic. Even though she wanted it back however, there was no denying her heart whenever he was around. When she said ""I love you"" to him, she meant it. She paused in her steps and gazed at him from her standing position at the foot of the bed. The cover ending at his hips and leaving his bare, lean, and muscular chest to her eyes. She would forget about magic for once and think about him who would provide it to her. She truly did love him...",6234395
1200,"They were released into the hall- they were supposed to go to first period- but Doc held them back. ""Now remember."" Doc said. ""According to my theory, you interfered with your parents"" first meeting. If they don""t meet, they don""t fall in love, they won""t get married, and they won""t have kids. That""s why your older brother""s disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you""ll be next."" ""Um, Doc?"" Elle said in a tiny voice. He looked at her. ""My future relies on this too."" He blinked. ""How so?"" ""My parents met because Marty""s parents introduced them at some dance. So- so if Marty""s parents don""t go-"" ""-Then your parents will never meet,"" Doc finished in a whisper. ""Great Scott. This is worse than I thought."" He turned to the two of them. ""Which one of you is older?"" Marty raised his hand. ""By how much?"" ""Two months."" ""You two are born so close together that you will both start disappearing at the same time if your parents don""t meet,"" Doc told them, his eyes wide. ""Marty will start first, naturally, but Elle will start only moments after."" ""Oh my God,"" Elle said, her face pale. ""Sounds heavy,"" Marty agreed. ""Weight has nothing to do with it,"" Doc said, confused. The bell rang, and immediately the halls filled with young bobbysoxers laughing and chatting, without a care in the world. Elle had almost forgotten what that had felt like. Doc bent down next to them. ""Do any of you see your parents?"" It was Marty""s turn to pale as he pointed at a boy getting getting kicked and bullied down the hallway. ""That""s him."" ""...and my dad,"" Elle muttered. George Mcfly and Daniel Phelan were walking down the corridor carrying what looked like their entire libraries in their arms. It didn""t help that a couple of jerks kept on kicking and hitting them from behind. Elle felt a rush of overprotection for her father and she damn near interfered, but Doc""s admonition rang through her mind. She stood by and watched helplessly as their fathers were walked on like they were doormats. ""Okay. Okay, you guys,"" George said. He got kicked again and laughed sarcastically. ""Very funny."" He turned around and Elle saw he had a ""KICK ME"" sign on his back with an arrow pointing at his butt. ""You guys are being real mature."" Daniel also turned around. He, too, had a ""KICK ME"" sign, but it was accompanied with an ""I""M WITH STUPID"" with an arrow pointing left- to George. ""Really, you guys, this is getting old, we don""t like it anymore-"" ""Maybe you were adopted,"" Doc said. ""Mcfly, Phelan!"" someone barked. A bald man with heavy forehead lines walked up to the two boys. With a jolt, Elle realized it was- ""Strickland,"" Marty said. ""Jesus, didn""t that guy ever have hair?"" ""Shape up, boys,"" Strickland said, ripping the papers off of their backs. ""You are slackers. Do you want to be slackers for the rest of your lives?"" Both boys murmured some kind of response, but Strickland was already walking away. ""What did your mother ever see in that kid?"" Doc questioned Marty. ""I don""t know, Doc,"" Marty replied. ""I don""t know.",2855986
144,"Although, I think he only did that for my sake, considering he was nearly wearing the same look as her when he""d ushered me away. ""Devious little asshole.' Anyway, it wasn""t long after that, that we soon found Stiles""s room. However, upon entering, we quickly noticed his lack of presence from within. Glancing between one another in trepidation, we quickly decided to scour the halls of the hospital to try and find him. Sadly though, after more than just a couple of minutes of looking high and low for the sleep deprived teen, we""d only come up empty handed in our search so far. Though, just when it seemed that all hope was lost in locating him, I finally noticed that Scott had somehow managed to catch wind of his friend nearby. However, he did make sure to try to appear casual about it with me around, as he glanced into nearby rooms for the mere sake of appearances, but before long, I found him practically yanking me towards one set of double doors in particular. Upon arriving in front of it, he practically shoved his way inside, as he pulled me along with him; all the while carefully making sure that the door didn""t catch on me as it closed behind us. Looking up towards the tall teen standing in front of us now, even I could tell that something seemed almost eerily off about him. In fact, you would think that almost any sane person would with just the aura he seemed to be giving off within that moment, but then again, maybe I only assumed that because I knew what had just occurred here. I guess, I may have been a little bias if we were being honest. Either way, nearly shaking in fear by this point, I realized that this wasn""t quite the Stiles I knew anymore; at least the one who was currently standing before me right now. Why? Because even I knew that he""d never been able to remain that calm in all the times that I""d seen him before. It was almost like he""d turned into a statue, and every last bit of his twitchy little ticks had all but vanished into thin air. This wasn""t Stiles. No....this was Void. Yet, almost as if he seemed to sense my new and shocking little revelation behind him, I noticed him tilt his head ever so slightly in my direction. Was it just me, or could he actually pick up on the terror that I was emitting right at that moment? Though, I think a part of me already knew that answer, because I""m pretty sure by that point my fear was practically saturating the air around us...at least, if Scott""s nose wrinkling in distaste wasn""t anything to go by. Either way, with these new little whispers of change forming around the three of us, I saw Stiles carefully raise his head up in surprise; almost as if he hadn""t known we were there all along. ""Stiles? You okay,"" Scott quickly asked in concern, as the boy in question finally turned around to give us his full attention. However, all I could see in that small bit of movement was the way his eyes gradually seemed to glance back and forth between the two of us; almost as if he were a predator eyeing his prey.",806976
842,"Many of the animals had united together under the ThunderCat banner, and he kept every group just separate enough to sure there would be no chance of switching of sides. The king had even sprinkled clerics throughout the ranks. ""You look nervous, Prince Lion-O."" She was wearing her cleric""s mask, but Lion-O recognized the voice, ""Cheetara."" He wanted to think she smiled, but couldn""t know for sure. She hopped onto the edge of the wall with perfect grace and looked out towards the approaching enemy, who could now be heard. ""I hope you made your peace with Tygra before the battle. It would be a shame if one of you perished without the other""s forgiveness."" They""d been fighting? Tygra hadn""t given that impression, but Lion-O guessed that being on the verge of war made whatever their fight was about seem insignificant. He looked to his guide, who was sitting to the left of Cheetara. She sighed before answering his unspoken question, ""As his heir, you were the only choice for the second command, but Tygra was worried that you were too young so he assigned an older General to lead with you."" Lion-O could see why that would upset him - he hated when his brother treated him like a cub. Though more removed in this situation, Lion-O could see it was just Tygra""s way of caring. He shook his head and answered Cheetara, ""We wished each other luck in the battle, though you know Tygra, he couldn""t resist a jab before riding off."" Cheetara""s eyes softened, ""Yes, I know Ty well."" It was the first time Lion-O had ever heard someone call Tygra that name. He didn""t like it. ""I""m surprised you""re not with him in battle. I would think he""d want you as close as possible."" Cheetara stiffened and leapt off the ledge. She snorted, ""He says I""d be too much of a distraction for him."" Looks like Lion-O wasn""t the only one Tygra had argued with before the battle. He felt a small part of his broken heart leap at the thought. He took her hand gently, ""He""s an idiot then."" ""Stop flirting, you two."" Lion-O smiled at the gruff voice, so that""s who he""d be sharing his command with? Lion-O turned with a grin. ""Hello to you too, Panthro."" The big cat looked the same as always, with his numb-chucks thrown over one shoulder. He looked out to the army in the distance. ""They""ll be here soon."" He turned Lion-O and motioned his head to the others on the wall. ""I think it""s time for you to give these men a rousing speech."" Lion-O saw that the other defenders all looked nervous and unsettled as they waited. Panthro was right - they needed a rousing speech. He just wasn""t so sure he should be the one to do it. But he gathered his courage and spoke loudly and clearly to those he may soon be dying with, ""Brothers and sisters in arms, you know that today we fight a great evil. It""s why we came together. Why we could put aside our many differences and grievances. I may not know you and after today I may never even have the chance. But still you are all my brothers, all my sisters, for the bond joined in battle is one that isn""t easily broken.",1497577
3052,"Jenny came up a little later to refill her drink, she started immediately needling Mira, ""Well, how is Fiore""s second prettiest model?"" ""I was just about to ask you that, Jenny."" Mira responded with a smile. She nodded to the empty glass in the frowning model""s hand. ""Can I refresh your drink?"" ""Yeah,"" Jenny handed Mira the glass. Mira began assembling a new drink for her rival. Jenny turned to face the table she""d been sitting at. ""You know, sometimes I miss having Laxus in our guild."" Mira""s hands stopped scooping ice for a moment before she forced herself to keep going. ""I always wondered, how did Laxus end up in your guild anyway?"" Mira hoped her voice didn""t betray her interest. Jenny didn""t act any differently, answering, ""Master wanted a good-looking bad boy in the guild. With his scar, tattoo and reputation, Laxus fit the description perfectly, so we recruited him."" Mira set down the finished drink by Jenny""s elbow, ""It didn""t have to do with the fact he was a powerful S Class Mage?"" ""That didn""t hurt, but no, it was the whole bad boy thing."" She looked over at the lightening dragon slayer. ""You know, I never did get a chance to sleep with him while he was in our guild. Bet he fucks like a stallion."" The smile didn""t leave Mira""s face, but her nails dug into her palms. ""I wouldn""t know."" Jenny grinned, and glanced back at Mira, ""Well, I""ll find out tonight and let you know."" As Jenny walked back to the table, Mira said through clenched teeth, ""Good luck with that."" Laxus wouldn""t sleep with her. Yes, Jenny was beautiful. And yes, they weren""t in any sort of official monogamous relationship, but still, he wouldn""t do that. Right? Right? Mira tried to put it out of her mind, but her eyes kept drifting to where Jenny sat next to Laxus. She laughed too loudly at his jokes and put her hands on his arms, eventually leaving them there, causally wrapped around his bicep. Laxus didn""t seem too interested, which may have comforted Mira if not for the fact that Laxus never looked interested in anyone. Even around her, he always acted cool. It bothered her all night, despite her best efforts. But she managed to keep it together. Until out of the corner of her eye, Mira saw Jenny moving closer to Laxus. She put a hand on his chest and whispered in his ear. Mira slammed a hand down on the bar and yelled, ""Jenny, get your hands off of my man!"" The guild went silent as everyone turned to where the Blue Pegasus mages were sitting to see what man Mira was referring to. Jenny smirked at Mira, leaning into Laxus further, who looked as surprised as everyone else at Mira""s outburst. Freed and Makarov reacted at the same time, ""What?!"" Freed turned to Laxus, ""Why didn""t you tell me? How did I not know?"" This triggered Evergreen and Bickslow to wonder the same thing. What kind of faithful bodyguards didn""t realize their fearless leader was dating someone? Makarov, on the other hand, yelled at Mira, ""Why would you pick him? You could do so much better, Mira."" Mira""s eyes hadn""t left Laxus"" though.",1497577
1813,"I am too! Anyways, this is where we let the fans ask you via this huge screen here. I""ll read you the questions and you answer. Like I said, if it gets too personal, just simply skip to the next question. Hiro: All right. AniUniverse: (presses the button and pops the first question) All righty...this first question is from httydforevergirl. It reads; a lot of fanmade pictures made you addicted to poptarts. Do you actually like poptarts? Hiro: Uh...they""re okay. But I don""t really eat those that much. AniUniverse: Okay then. It""s cool, I like poptarts too. (chuckles) Next question is from...(pushes the button and another question pops up) Midnight Dragon Conquerer...Do you have a crush on GoGo Tomaga? Hiro: (widens eyes) Um...we""re just friends. AniUniverse: You know that when you say that, a lot of people will assume that you do. But we""ll just leave that where it is. Hiro: Thanks. AniUniverse: Next up...(presses the button with another question) from DiamontStar...was Honey your brother Tadashi""s girlfriend? Hiro: Not that I know of. I don""t think my brother dated her. AniUniverse: Okay then. Who""s next...(pushes button and another question pops up) Two questions from RandomChick; first one is maybe you""re going through puberty, but what you hit your growth spurt yet? Hiro: (silent) Next question. AniUniverse: Good call, dude. Second question is...what do you think and what was it like when you first met your team? Hiro: Much better question. Um...it was amazing and not to mention awesome at the same time. When I first met them in my brother""s school, they were pretty cool with me and I never actually thought that we""d actually end up being a superhero team. But it""s awesome. AniUniverse: Top man. (pushes the button for the next question) This next one is from HighCrest Tomoko...is your intelligence too much to match mine? My IQ is in the 1000""s. Audience: Ooooooohhhhhhhh... Hiro: Name the time and place and we""ll see how who""s IQ is much better. Audience and AniUniverse: OH, SNAP! AniUniverse: Okay...moving on. (pushes the button for another question) Dragon Faller asks how did it feel losing Tadashi? Hiro: (sighs) That""s actually one of my least favorite questions to ask. It actually hurt me that I lost Tadashi...someone that I admire, look up to and learn from. We may get on each other""s nerves and all...but he""s been the only family I had...besides Aunt Cass. AniUniverse: We""re very sorry for your loss, dude. Wanna go to another question? Hiro: Yeah, I""d appreciate that. AniUniverse: (pushes the button for another question) This next one is from...gxfan537. How cool is it to work on Microbots? Hiro: Much cool. Because it can transform into anything in your command, whether it""s objects, person or anything else. AniUniverse: I want one of those microbots, dude. Next question is from...(pushes the button and another question pops up) pickleball6 and it""s got a lot of questions. I don""t know if you would like to answer all these, but I""ll read them anyway.

2240,"""I""ll give him a ride,"" she says. ""Straight home from the movie,"" Regina demands. ""No stops at the diner or library or whatever the hell Henry tries to convince you is a good idea."" Henry""s expression is somewhere between tired and exasperated, but thankfully he keeps his mouth shut and doesn""t say anything to escalate the already tangible tension. ""Fine,"" Emma agrees. ""I need to go,"" Regina announces, and then leans over to pull Henry into a stiff-armed hug. She""s close enough that Emma catches a whiff of the now-familiar the fragrance she""s wearing. Regina always smells like apples, but it""s not the fake scent that comes from Bath and Body Works"" Country Apple. It""s more real somehow and lacks the cloying sweetness of a manufactured fragrance. Regina""s scent should be comforting, but Emma""s never been a big apple fan. Apples are a relatively cheap fruit, and she had been fed more than enough of them through school lunch programs and foster care. Regina pulls away from the boy a second later, turning and heading back toward her car without another word or threat. Emma puts her hand on Henry""s shoulder, turning to open the glass doors of the lobby of the theater. ""I don""t need a ride,"" Henry tells her. ""I can get home by myself."" ""Kid, you""re the kid,"" Emma says in exasperation as the smell of buttered popcorn hits her nose. ""It""s natural she wants to know where you are, especially after your little adventure in the mine."" ""She""s not my mother,"" he mutters again. ""She""s the Evil Queen."" There is no way Emma is touching that one. If Regina had been Rex, Emma thinks Henry would have been trying to hook them up à la The Parent Trap. The more cynical part of her wonders if that isn""t actually what he""s doing, since the twenty-first century is the age of equal opportunity loving. The last person in the world Emma wants to play the ""Henry Has Two Mommies"" game is with Regina, so Emma really hopes she""s reading too deeply into things. Emma doesn""t have anything against women, but she sure as hell has something against Regina. The hatesex would not be worth it. Henry has turned Regina into the enemy in his head, and Emma knows she""s supposed to be the hero. Archie told her it""s easier for Henry to paint people into black and white roles, and she shouldn""t do anything to destroy his fantasy. The idea that Henry could possibly be right is seductive, and she refuses to indulge his fantasy that far. If Regina really is a wicked witch, then Emma would be justified in sweeping him away. The thought of kidnapping briefly passes through her mind. It would be so, so easy to take Henry away from Storybrooke, and start a new life somewhere else. A good bounty hunter knows how to fake the papers, and Emma is convinced she could get away with it if she gets Henry to play along. She could spin the Sleeping Beauty story, maybe, and convince Henry that he""s a prince who needs to be hidden from the Evil Queen. All she has to do is get him into her car, and spin him a tale. It""s tempting, but Emma isn""t going to offer him that poisoned apple. She can""t live a lie.",1112924
45,"Hisoka closed his eyes, ""I feel... you, and... others. Many others, but there emotions still feel distant. Some are closer, the three people in eye sight. Ones angry, the... dogwalkerI think. And..."" His eyes flew open and a blush ran across his face. ""Um..... the other two are... somewhat, busy, at the moment..."" Tsuzuki couldn""t help but laugh, giving the blonde a rough pat on the head. He turned Hisoka""s head towards him, eyes connecting together. ""Focus just on me, Hisoka. You know I love you, my feelings are always strong. ""Hestitantly, Hisoka nodded. xxxIt was like this, that Tsuzuki and I spent the day. We spent many days together and although I feel that my fear of humans may have passed, I believe I""m becoming too dependant on Tsuzuki. I haven""t told him yet, what I think, but if Muraki knew this weakness... I fear what he could do to me. I don""t want to know, I don""t want to even think about what sick and twisted games he wants to play with my body this time. It makes me sick. Sometimes, I have nightmares but they feel so real that it scares me. I keep telling myself if was only a dream, myimaganation but all the sensations are too real. I""m scared. The days pass by faster now, because I keep dreading the time I finally fall asleep. Will I dream? What will happen this time? I want to know, but I don""t. I want Tsuzuki to save me, but I don""t know how he can. If this keeps going, eventually I""ll never be able to sleep. At that point, I will no longer be able to hide myinsceurties. My stress builds up little my little each day and nothing I have done has provided a releaf for it. Sometimes, when I""m with Tsuzuki, he makes me feel like things will be allright again. Like I""m safe. However, this is just a lie. I don""t feel safe at all. I just feel what he""s feeling. Who am I? Sometimes I can""t even tell anymore. In public, I only focus on Tsuzuki and he guides me through the darkness. Gradually I began to notice that I could no longerseperate my own feelings from his. Do I feel happy at the moment? Or angry? My mind tells me I should feel one way, but I often feel many emotions at once. I think I""m slowly losing it. Barely a month has gone by, and already I feel like my path will lead me to the brink of an endless, cold black hole. Muraki will be coming back for me. If he does not, then he knows that I will go back to him. I have to get to that mansion. If I can""t go back to the person I used to be, then I""m not going to look back on my life. I will give it up. It doesn""t matter if I become his slave or doll, if someone can take this pain away I will gladly serve them until my life is no longer my own. At that point, I""m as good as dead. I will pass on, living in a dream where Tsuzuki and I can be together like it used to be. This must be my minds interpreteration of the illusion fields, a place where one is always happy in the after life. Maybe like heaven, I don""t know. But I can""t go on anymore. I have to go back to my hell. Maybe... this is my penitence for being born and living a failure to my family.",583994
346,"""How did you guess?"" There was that smile-in-his-voice tone again. ""Well, you are very handsome... and I cannot see you playing the Phantom, so..."" ""Ahh, so you think I""m handsome, jagiya?"" ""I-"" Heat rushed to my cheeks. He was laughing at me, laughing! ""We-well, looks are not everything, you know now!"" ""No... but they help,"" He said with a flirtatious edge, ""Don""t worry; I""ll keep your secret. And yes, I""ll be playing Raoul."" I glanced idly towards my computer and froze. It was 2am. We""d been talking for four hours, ""Wow... please tell me you do not have rehearsal in the morning."" ""Oh, I do."" I jumped up to shut my computer down. We both needed sleep, him for his acting and me... just to sleep. Sleeping was usually a better alternative than facing life awake. At least, when my nights were dreamless, which most of them happily were. And those that weren""t... robbed me of good sleep for days after, ""We need to go to bed!"" I heard a strange noise on the other end. A sort of choking sound, followed by Zen clearing his throat, ""Oh, I guess we do."" ""Well, um... goodnight Zen. Sorry I didn""t play for you, though..."" I looked outside at the subtle tinges of lighter blues on the horizon, ""... probably wasn""t the best plan anyway. I don""t want to be hated by Rika""s former neighbors."" ""Ah, so you are in the same apartment as her""s; Seven thought so,"" I froze, but he went on. Why did I seem to slip up so much around this man? ""Don""t worry, the only one""s who know the address of Rika""s apartment are Seven and V anyway."" ""Oh, um... okay,"" I shifted the phone to my other shoulder and removed my coin skirt. I hadn""t even had the chance to practice. Setting them on my nightstand, I pulled out a plain t-shirt and baggy pajama bottoms, ""Really, we should sleep."" ""We should,"" Zen said, but still neither of us hung up the phone. I pulled back the covers and crawled into bed. Such an odd thing, so speak so much with someone I hardly knew. Especially given my... history. Maybe it was because he had no idea where I actually was, or what I even looked like, that calmed the anxiety. It wasn""t that Zen was bad - I""d only seen evidence of good, if narcissistic, behavior - but that I knew there was no possible chance he could ever hurt me. I was safe. ""You didn""t answer me; do you want to hear some lines?"" He teased, chuckling as I settled down. I rolled my eyes, ""A lullaby, perhaps?"" I didn""t even try and stifle a yawn, giving my go ahead without thinking, ""Sure, Hyun."" ""Ahh, I haven""t heard my birth name spoken in a long while."" ""... are you gonna sing or keep talking?"" He laughed. I was about to give up and just end the call when his melodic voice floated through the speakers. It was low, not the back-seats reaching voice from the YouTube video, but still just... beautiful. Even the slight static and robotic nature of the phone couldn""t put a damper to it. ""No more talk of darkness; forget these wide-eyed fears~"" My eyes slide closed, my usual ignored exhaustion getting the better of me for once. Or it was his voice, I couldn""t tell, ""I""m here, nothing can harm you.",748687
2665,"They began to make their way to the door, in a not quite straight line. Mark pointed a finger at Owen, wanting to make something clear, ""I""m from New York, it""s going to take a lot to impress me."" Owen saw Mark stagger and put his hand on his arm to steady the other man, much like he did after the fight. ""Oh, you might be surprised with Seattle."" A/N: I wrote nothing that is italized. Vows Preston Burke looked over his vows for the woman he was about to marry for the hundredth time. He changed a sentence and read them again. He felt like starting over once more. Christina, I could promise to hold you and to cherish you. He""d written his vows for Cristina in one shot. I could promise to be there in sickness and in health. He loved this woman he""d proposed to, she""d make a fine wife. She""d be the Adele to his Chief, a traditional woman with a hidden strength and dignity. I could say ""till death do us part. Cristina would""ve been his Ellis Grey. But I won""t. He""d loved Cristina, so much that he walked away. He didn""t want to see her break herself into becoming the woman he wanted. They both deserved better than that. Those vows are for optimistic couples. Preston had always placed his bets on long-shots, and part of him always secretly hoped she""d come back to him. The ones full of hope. But his infrequent calls to Derek had crushed that hope. She""d found someone new. And I do not stand here, on my wedding day, optimistic or full of hope. He remembered the call distinctly, Derek had just casually mention Yang""s new guy and feelings that weren""t supposed to be there anymore came rushing back. Burke found that he desperately wanted more information but didn""t know how to go about getting it. I am not optimistic, I am not hopeful. ""Is it serious?"" Derek mumbled on the other line, as if he""d been swallowing food and had been caught mid-bite. ""I don""t even see it, but Meredith inists and she would know more about it then I would."" I am sure, I am steady, and I know. ""What""s he like?"" ""Why do you want to know?"" Burke didn""t even want to think the answer to that. I am a heart man: I take them apart, I put them back together. ""Just curious."" ""I don""t really know him much. He""s pretty guarded. I didn""t like him much at first, but he""s growing on me. He""s a good man."" Sounded a lot like Cristina. I hold them in my hands. Derek shifted the conversation. ""So, another wedding. That must be exciting. I""m guessing I""m not going to be best man at this one."" Burke could see Derek smiling and felt his own lips tug up. ""You""ve never even met the bride, Derek. With Cristina, marrying her was practically a lifetime commitment to you too because of Meredith."" I am a heart man. That was the moment Derek brought up his own enagement to Meredith. Burke refrained from asking the question if he""d be invited to that one. So this, I am sure. Cristina would be certain to be maid of honor. She""d have to be there to keep Meredith from freaking out, just like she did at their wedding. Would he want to see her? You are my partner, my lover, my very best friend.",1497577
1340,"The secret to being a great leader of the team is to be a team player. Everybody has a chance to shine rather than just one person."" ""That""s always been a mainstay for us. I may not be like you, but I""ll try."" Isaac added. ""Awesome."" Morrison replied. Soon afterwards, the bell rings and the friends left the back part of the gym and headed for the hallways for the next class and as Morrison walks down the hallway, he saw Meena walking past him and from the look on her face and the way she walks with her head lowered, he knew that there was something going on and ""Trevor"" starts blinking on the inside of his mind, thinking he might have done something. ""Hey, Meena."" Morrison called out. When Meena rose her head and faced Morrison, he was blindsided by how crestfallen she had looked and asked, ""Are you okay?"" ""I""m fine. It""s just...Trevor""s just asking me to be his girlfriend and no one else""s. I have to meet him for lunch."" Meena replied, before walking off. That proves to Morrison that Trevor""s got Meena under his spell, but not in the way she had wanted. So Morrison""s taking a bow from track, but there""s more challenges on the horizon; how will Meena handle going to lunch with Trevor? You""ll see next! And here""s where this so-called ""lunch date"" between Meena and Trevor went down...and both are about to have an audience that exposes Trevor""s dark side. Chapter 15: Not the Lunch Date in Mind At lunch, Morrison and his friends were just talking while eating as usual and of course, joined by Ash and Johnny at the same time and Morrison wanted to get to know a little more about Johnny and Ash and from what Morrison heard about Johnny, he was surprised to learn that Johnny wanted to get out of the criminal business his dad wanted him to do and just forge his path onto music more and that really amazed Morrison and Milo the most. Milo spoke out about it by saying, ""I""m surprised that you""re not a part of that because most kids would fall into a life of crime and the parents would totally freak out about it, but it was reversed."" ""Yeah, well...that""s the story of my life."" Johnny added. ""Interesting. And Ash, your boyfriend stepped out on you?"" asked Shawn. ""Yep. I went home from rehearsal one day and I saw Lance singing with another girl. I was devastated to see that, but at the same time...it was just a blessing because I had to step out on my own. Lance thinks that I""m holding him back and that I can""t write my own songs, but really...he held me back to be the front. I think if those events didn""t happen, I""d still be with him and I""d still be a back-up, so I""m kinda thankful for it."" Ash added. ""Wonder how this Lance guy screwed that up?"" asked Kevin. ""He""s been trying to get me back together with him, but if you""re still with another girl, why would you want to get back with me?"" asked Ash. ""What""s that other girl""s name?"" asked Morrison. ""Becky."" Ash answered. ""Becky? My sister hangs out with her at school and they even go to the mall together. I met her once and there""s something about her that I didn""t really like."" Shawn admitted.",1276465
3480,"This part is entirely fictitious; I just hope that my own story may end in a similar way... Jimmy: The anniversary of the guys"" death was a Tuesday this year, and I arrived in Arlington shortly after 11 a.m. I had barely entered the cemetery when I spotted a person standing in front of the guys"" memorial. My heart started racing wildly, but I noticed very fast that this couldn""t be Yves. Unmistakably, the person was a man. It turned out to be Assistant Director Skinner. I talked to him for a while, but there wasn""t much we could talk about. I asked him about the agents Mulder and Scully, but he wouldn""t tell me anything. He just said that they were fine. The next person to arrive was Agent Reyes, and Agent Doggett came a few moments later. They were both very nice to me, although I had the slight suspicion that it took them a while to remember who I was. Once they had remembered, though, they asked me how I was and what I was doing. We talked a while, but then they had to leave. They were working on a new case, I reckoned, and their lunch break was over. They left together. I looked after them and noticed that they were walking very close side by side. Was it a coincidence... or was there something going on that I didn""t know? None of my business, of course. But this made me think of Yves, and my heart cringed. I looked around, and when I was convinced that I was alone, I stepped closer to the memorial and started talking. ""Hello, guys,"" I said in a low voice. ""It""s been a while since I visited you the last time. As a matter of fact, I haven""t been here since this time last year. And so much has happened since then... I don""t even know where to start. I live in Chicago now. Life hasn""t been easy since we lost you, you know. I miss my task, and I even miss you bossing me about. After all, we had some fun, didn""t we? ""I""ve got some serious problem going on with Yves. You may not believe it, but I saw her again. I told you we""d lost the contact, didn""t I? Well, anyway, we met again in a club a few months ago. And what can I say... it was as if we""d never parted. There was still something going on between us, if you know what I mean. And I didn""t make pretending or something, I tell you! There was something. But Yves was pretty drunk, and so I don""t know whether she even remembers what she did. She kissed me, you know. She just kissed me, and then she disappeared into the crowd. No explanation, no further conversation, nada! And now I don""t know what to make of all the fuss. Shall I call her again and insist that she explain it to me? Or shall I just sit back and wait until she does something? You know, women... It""s so difficult to understand what they want; sometimes I doubt that they know themselves. (I reckon I""m not the first man on earth to reach this conclusion.) ""Guys, help me! I""ve got the feeling that Yves is avoiding me, and I don""t know why. Maybe she""s embarrassed. Or she waits for me to take the first step. Or she can""t remember a thing. But I need to do something, or otherwise I""ll go mad!",240213
2398,"Mikey motioned the movement Brand was making with his arm stretcher, and mimed tying a knot. Everyone nodded. ""Hey, Brand, how far can you stretch that?"" Mikey asked him. ""It""s not that hard,"" Brand said, demonstrating. When it was stretched to its limit, they pounced on him. Chunk and Mikey leapt onto his legs to distract him, while Mouth, Data, and Elle tied the handles into a knot. ""Get off me!"" he squirmed and kicked, but the handles held good. The Goonies burst out the front door and onto the drive to fetch their bikes. Mouth paused in front of Brand""s bike and began unscrewing the tire caps. ""What""re you doing?"" Mikey asked, throwing his leg over his own bike. ""It took him three hundred and seventy-six lawn mower jobs to pay for that! It""s his most favorite thing in the world!"" ""Now it""s the most flattest thing in the world, besides Elle""s chest,"" Mouth said. Mikey was about to make a smart reply but then Mouth added, ""Come on, let""s go!"" ""I""ll hit you so hard, that when you wake up, your clothes will be out of style!"" Mikey heard Brand threaten from inside the house. Mikey felt a twinge of guilt, but the rush of adrenaline pushed him on. He pedaled to catch up with everyone else. Elle""s ankle was killing her, but the prospect of finding rich stuff and saving the Goon Docks wiped out all other feeling. The wind rippling through her hair, trees and buildings blurring together as she zipped past them- this was where she belonged. Not in a dress, plunked at a table with several other socialites, as her mother had hoped. Riding with her friends, all boys, the Goonies. ""Hey, everyone!"" Mr. Walsh waved as they passed the museum. Tall, thin, and balding, Mr. Walsh was the nicest man Elle had ever met. She felt a surge of pity towards him- he shouldn""t have to lose his house to rich idiots like the Perkins. This made her more determined than ever to find Willy""s treasure. ""Hey, Mr. Walsh!"" they all called in turn. Everyone followed Mikey, because they all assumed he knew where he was going, but actually, he didn""t. So he led them to the local drugstore to find a current map of Astoria. ""Um, Mikey? Please tell me this isn""t where the rich stuff is,"" Elle said. ""It""s not,"" Mikey assured her, letting his bike fall on the curb. ""I just have to check something-"" he scurried inside, everyone else on his heels. But once they were in, everyone went their seperate ways- Elle and Mouth to the magazines and Chunk and Data to the junk food. ""Oh my God,"" Elle heard Mikey say. ""I know these rocks, I know where this is! Guys! Check it out! I know how to get there, this is Astoria, this is where the rich stuff""s buried- guys! We can go there, we can get the rich stuff-!"" ""Jerk alert!"" Mouth called over the latest issue of Boudoir. At first Elle thought Mouth had meant the cashier, who was trying to bargain with Data. But then she looked past him and saw- ""Troy!"" Data said disgustedly. Tall, athletic, and handsome, Troy strode in with an air of confidence that could rival any businessman""s. He was accompanied by two high school girls.",2855986
3436,"NOW DO YOU SEE THE DANGERS OF WISHING FOR ADULT VICES WITH THE FAIRIES!"" Timmy shivers and says, ""Y...y...y...yes.... but is the musicial number even nessessary?"" Jorgan replies, ""Umm... I just like musical numbers...AND YES IT IS! Now you see what why little kids should not drink beer, especially if they get their fairy godparents to give them it! BINKY! Give me da rulebook!"" Then Binky makes ""Da Rules"" appear and Jorgan blasts it with his giant wand and then he continues, ""From now on, Fairies will never ever ever ever ever no matter how they cry or beg supply their fairy godchildren with alcohol, drugs, tobacco, firearms, and the winning odds in gambling... then again it counts as cheating so it""s already in the rulebook but either way... NO ADULT VICES!"" Timmy asks, ""Firearms?"" Jorgan looks sad and says, ""Yeah... there was a incident where a kid wished for a real rifle and well... he shot his eye out! You think something like this is funny in ""A Christmas Story"" but it isn""t in that case... umm are you taking pictures of me crying Cosmo?"" Cosmo then says, ""Umm... nope! Eggplant Panini?"" Jorgan then eats a eggplant panini... with his biceps. Wanda then says, ""See Timmy, parents/fairy godparents, we still have to be responcible for your well being therefore... no beer! Timmy then says, ""Well Wanda I have seen the light... from now on no it""s clean living for me!"" Jorgan then blurts out, ""Oh and I know what you""re thinking Turner, you are not wishing for access to ""The Naughty Boy channel"" that""s also going to be in the rule book!"" Timmy snaps his fingers and says, ""Darn! I had that idea! Jorgan just shouts, ""LOOK! JUST BE GLAD YOU STILL HAVE COSMO, WANDA, AND THAT BABY! Now that I have shown you your dark future I must go... there is another boy who is using his fairies for adult vices and I got to show him his dark future as well!"" So Jorgan flies away on his jetpack and Binky just vanishes. Timmy then looks at Cosmo, Wanda, and Poof and just drinks a bottle of chocolate milk to show that he will never cause that dark future to happen. Wanda then asks, ""So now did you learn anything from all this?"" Timmy replies, ""Yes and now I know..."" And Cosmo then replies, ""And knowing is half the battle!"" Wanda then asks Cosmo, ""Then what""s the other half?"" Cosmo then replies, ""STUPIDITY! YEE HAA! Watch me put underwear on my head while I eat this eggplant panini with my feet!"" Timmy then says, ""I feel like a changed kid... and now to make sure I don""t have a dark future..."" (The next day at school) Tootie is swinging on the swings by herself, but then she sees Timmy holding a box of chocolates and a bunch of roses. Tootie""s eyes are as huge as saucers and she asks, ""For me? You mean it! OH TIMMY!"" Then Tootie then hugs Timmy and then Trixie sees this and Timmy then says, ""Sorry Trixie but your ego is as big as your ""badunkadunk""!"" Trixie is furious and walks away as she thinks to herself, ""Why does everyone in this fanfic think I have a big ""badunkadunk?"" Tootie then says, ""Timmy I had the strangest dream...",910821
511,"Vayne backed Larsa into a corner of the bedroom. It wasn""t any sort of surprise that in no matter where Vayne went, the people there would already have one of the most grandeur bedrooms available for his personal use. Vayne had initially called Larsa up under the pretenses of work, given the situation in which Vayne was going to present himself to the public of Rabanastre in a couple of days. Yet, even in knowing his brother better then anyone, he still had sometimes had trouble being able to tell what Vayne would really be up to. Larsa felt his back press against the corner of the stone brick wall. He couldn""t look get away this time; since not only was he short, but Vayne was naturally (abnormally, if you asked him) tall to begin with. The older man towered over Larsa and prevented him from escaping. He lifted Larsa""s chin gently so they made eye contact. ""I think that maybe you are in your own imagined relationship then, as I was deemed to be. My Larsa,"" Vayne slid his other hand down Larsa""s back, proceeding to imitate calming massage effects. Larsa couldn""t resist this time as Vayne""s own skills in knowing exactly what to do and where overpowered any resistance Larsa still held. Vayne leaned inwards, his lips moving towards Larsa""s hesitant ones. ""You""re as sensitive as always, I see."" Larsa scoffed, ""And you do not change either, brother."" Yet he felt his body start to move under Vayne""s power, responding to his advances no matter what his mind wanted to do. Most of the time Larsa found himself unable to resist Vayne in this aspect. Although in considering his noticeable lack of romantic engagements outside of his royal and political duties, Larsa decided that that was the main cause of any confusion he felt in matters of relation towards romance and the heart. Vayne""s hands found their way around Larsa white dress shirt, taking no time in getting straight to the point of the matter. Larsa looked away, his eyes finding their way towards the glass windows beside him. Outside he could see the clear blue sky; the airships that rode through the air sent a pang of longing across his mind. He unconsciously leaned his neck to the side, taking cues from Vayne on what he wanted his body to do next. Lips made their way around and yet he only found himself able to focus on the airships outside. ""Is this... are we doing the right thing?"" The lack of response led Larsa to believe that his brother either didn""t hear him, or actively chose not to answer. Sometimes he felt this entire relationship was built upon a cage, never able to evolve into something more. Having to experience the same things over and over again; always in a constant motion of familiarity and soft comfort. He felt Vayne""s hands move across his pants. The long, dark green set (comeplete with white fancy dress shirt) he would often wear ""around the castle"" when he wasn""t expecting to go out. Warm, strong yet gentle fingers that made their way across and down. Their last stop being towards the front of his body.",583994
3406,"But even with all these once closed opportunities, the thing she missed the most was having someone there. So she tried to ignore that pain when she realized no one was going to join her when she went in the shower, that fear that no one was there to protect her at night, that sadness that she won""t find anyone like Roman ever. Roman on the other hand had become extremely lethargic, he worked his business, but as soon as he was alone. He did nothing but drink and eat, go to the bathroom and sleep. He never thought her not being there would affect him to such an extent. It didn""t with the last woman. It drove him to near insanity when he noticed her things were missing in the first month and then as the months continued, it killed him inside. He had been lonely before, but when you are with someone for so long and then this happens. How could he not crumble into a million pieces? His goons noticed it, his business became less prominent because of it, and his authority was slowly diminishing. He wanted her back again, but there was no way she was coming back. So he did something he told himself he wouldn""t, he sent a goon out each day to follow her and watch her. He had them take pictures of her and return them to him, he would hide them in an envelope in his desk and look at them every so often. She wouldn""t notice this because it was a different man every day and that man kept very well hidden. Roman wondered if she was happier and some pictures proved that she was. But what irked him was that she had no socialization with anyone, she remained alone and dull, quiet and to herself. That was until after about a year and she started dating again, Roman yet again broke his promise to himself. After every date, he would have a goon beat the shit out of the man and send him on his way with a warning. She would wonder why they never called her back, it was because of Roman. Then Roman began leaving gifts at her door, does it count if he at least promised he wouldn""t? He sent a goon to do it instead. The first gift was a bouquet of flowers, her favorite roses. The second gift was a puppy, she picked it up and called around for its owner and when no one took him back she brought it inside and called it Angel. The third was a box of designer earrings, the most expensive of the gifts. And not once did she consider that Roman was bringing these gifts to her, in the end, however, all that mattered to Roman was that she took them. She walked Angel every day and the earrings she wore on other occasions, the flowers eventually rotted, but she had kept them in a vase next to her front door. Roman stopped sending gifts when her next door neighbor asked her out on a date. He hated the guy, but not only because he was dating Lina, but because he had claimed that those gifts were from him. One of the goons caught him talking to her one day as she was walking Angel. ""So... Do you know anything about these gifts that have been sitting in front of my door nearly every morning?""",6234395
315,"Even the social worker who handled his case didn""t bat an eyelash at him. The kids at the center didn""t socialize with him, kept towards themselves instead. Sora knew his childhood was rather wretched. That was why he forced himself to grow up so fast. Then maybe he can leave that dreary childhood. Then he could start the life that he wanted. With friends. With family. With people that cared about him and people that he cared about. Tidus was the first to notice him whenever the blond saw the older boy walk by, carrying a heavy load of groceries. His apartment was a few blocks away from Sora""s. It was almost a weekly routine for the blond to take stealthy peeks at the brown-haired boy through their window whenever he would pass by. Weeks passed by before Tidus finally introduced himself. And Sora was happy. For he never had someone talk to him so openly and willingly. Sora was a year older than Tidus, but age didn""t play a role in their budding friendship. That day was also when Sora felt his burden was lighter. Not only because Tidus had taken part of the burden on his groceries, but the blond had taken the burden of loneliness from his heart. That was how Sora knew the gang that was his circle of friends. Roxas, brother figure of Tidus. Namine, the mother of the circle and Vincent, the stolid father figure to all. They took him in, like how a younger brother takes in an adopted older brother with open arms and a warm, toothy smile. That was the day when Sora felt the sun had truly shone in his life. That was the day he was thankful for having lived. But everything slid to darkness when he came here. His friends disappeared into it. His light was overwhelmed by the nothingness that was creeping slowly towards his soul. He could feel it. Almost feel it. The earth was digging itself around him, almost ready to swallow him. The sensation of falling, getting ready to plunge into a pitfall that never ended. A hole that led to a world that never was, and never will be. Slowly... Slowly... Just a little more and everything will end... He could feel himself losing air...losing sight... A nice feeling to let go... A little more... Into a world where light cannot pierce... Where everything would truly disappear... Memories...soul...heart... Almost... Almost... ... ... ... ""MOOMBA!!"" ""Gah!"" Sora jolted up with a scream, fright reflected in his sky-blue eyes. A rather strong, childish voice boomed around him, drawing him from his melancholy and from his eager desire for a quick death. Yes...he was asking for death...sweet, maternal death...the embrace of a morbid mother...so dark...so hard and cold and... ""MOOMBA!!"" ""GAH!"" Sora was jolted up once more, finally standing from where he had lain. Alright, that was just pure irritating. Once, he can forgive. Twice is just foolhardy and annoying. Just as he was about to retort something nasty as to whoever was disturbing his ""alone-time"", he was greeted by a red, smallish, three-foot high, lion-cub look alike with a spiky mane, and wild green eyes. ""MOOMBA!!""",583064
1461,"""Will you be breast feeding him or..."" Andy didn""t give him time to finish as she said, ""Breast feeding. I heard a urban legend that it makes them smarter."" ""And makes the mother skinner,"" John said remembering the rest of the legend. Andy looked up at him and hit him. Suddenly she felt really tired as she yawned. ""I thought you might be tired dear. Maybe it""s best if you all leave and give her some rest. Trust me she needs it. Anna help change her bed please so that she could sleep on something more comfortable,"" the doctor said as they all walked out of the room. John""s POV. John felt like he was on cloud 9 right now as he walked through the halls. He felt so happy and Magneto noticed it, ""He was truly an amazing child John. You should be very proud; you""re the one that made him."" John smiled and looked up at him and said, ""I am."" ""Come boy, I think both you and I should have a smoke,"" Magneto said pulling out a pack of cigarettes. ""Haven""t had one of these in a while, but I think this is a big enough event to,"" Magneto said as they walked out to the garden that was a place for the nurses to sit out and eat or just take a smoking break. Mystique soon joined them after dropping by the cafeteria to get a cup of coffee. Andy""s POV. Back in the hospital room though Andy had just fallen asleep when her mind let all her barriers fall. She could feel someone reaching out to her and she reached back the best she could. ""Andy are you there,"" Xavier asked. ""Yes,"" She said. ""What has happened,"" Xavier asked since he had felt a new presence in the world. ""I gave birth to a healthy baby boy,"" she could feel a happy aura in her mind and Xavier say, ""I""m so happy for you. I will tell Bobby. What is his name?"" ""Jonathan Bobby Allerdyce,"" she said and then quickly asked something, ""Xavier is he...is he a mutant."" Xavier was quiet for a few moments before he answered. ""Yes he is, but what he is I do not know,"" Xavier said. ""Thank you,"" Andy said as she slipped from the connection and fell into a deep sleep. Xavier""s POV. Xavier opened his eyes to his office and found Bobby there. ""So is she okay,"" Bobby asked since Xavier had called him in when he had felt something happening to Andy earlier. ""Yes she and the baby are fine,"" Bobby""s face lightened and said, ""What do you mean her and the baby."" ""She has given birth to a healthy baby boy,"" Bobby smiled as his eyes looked down. He couldn""t believe she did it. He never thought she would make it all the way. ""And Bobby,"" Bobby looked up at him with a smile still on his face. ""She named him Jonathan Bobby Allerdyce,"" Xavier said with a happy glint in his eyes. Bobby laughed at the irony in the name. John would probably be thinking the same thing right now. His name put together with is ex-friend""s was kind of ironic. ""Is she going to be alright,"" Bobby asked again. ""Yes she""s good and healthy herself,"" Xavier said and then added, ""You should call your older cousin and let her know."" Bobby nodded and got up and headed on out. Xavier looked down at his papers and couldn""t help but smile.",806976
3824,"Dio chuckled and relaxed. Jin sighed in relief at that. The boy was like a hermit crab, who kept going in and out of its shell. He needed to find a way get the introvert to be relaxed around them. Jin""s relief was short-lived however, when he heard a sickening crunch beside him and as he turned towards Dio with a shocked expression, the boy was spitting out his food into the sand with a pained and choking expression. ""Dio!"" Jin rubbed the boy""s naked, wondering if he choked on the lobster meat. He stared at the food that was spat and was irked when he saw the meat and a whole lot of the shell of the lobster""s claw. ""You idiot."" Jin chastised, as he bought Dio""s chin up towards him. ""Why the hell would you eat the shell along?"" Dio""s face exhibited pure surprise. ""I...you""re not supposed to eat that?"" He reddened again at his mistake. ""You goof."" Jin sighed, but he then smiled reassuringly as he picked the pieces of whatever shell remained in Dio""s chin and at the corner of his lips. ""Ow..."" Dio cringed, as he began moving his tongue inside his mouth. ""Here."" Jin took Dio by the chin again and nudged his mouth open with his index finger. ""There""s a piece of shell sticking in your tongue..."" Jin stared at his fingers. ""Eh...they""re dirty...what to do? I can""t use my hands to get it out..."" ""Is something wrong with him?"" Both boys turned towards the speaker. ""Master Sieghart!"" Jin ""ooh""ed. ""Ah, it seems he got a piece of shell stuck in his tongue. I can""t get it out using my fingers..."" Sieghart tilted his head sideways, looking pensive. ""Hey, what was your name again?"" Sieghart turned towards Dio. Said boy took a glance at Jin, asking for approval. Jin nodded, mouthing ""It""s okay."" ""D-Dio..."" He replied, cringing when he moved his tongue to speak. ""Dio, I need you - "" Seighart tilted Dio""s chin to face him. "" - I need you to open your mouth so I can see where the piece is."" Said boy somehow took a pace back, but Sieghart held Dio""s chin in a steadfast grip, though the boy still refused to open his mouth. ""Now Jin."" Sieghart sighed exasperatingly. ""Please tell your boyfriend to open his mouth for me."" Jin sputtered from drinking his soda in a can, as he stared at Sieghart with Coke still dripping from his mouth and nose. ""H-he""s not my boyfriend!"" Dio immediately turned towards Jin. ""We""re not?"" Jin looked surprised at the clarity and tone of the question. For a second there, he was just getting used to Dio""s stuttering and shyness. But there was this overwhelming will from those two words and - ""I-it""s not like you asked me out yet."" Jin retorted, but then covered his mouth in shock to avoid shooting himself in the foot once more. ""Bu - "" Dio was about to answer back when his face got turned around and found himself lip locking with Sieghart.",583064
1135,"Everything seemed eerily dark, slightly dank, too. ""Zidane!"" Zidane jumped up as a hand touched his shoulder. He spun around to find himself face to face with Eiko, her floral yellow billowing slightly with the cool wind. ""Eiko. Where are we? The last place I remember being is in Alexandria castle."" Eiko grinned. ""This place is called the Mists of Avalon. You know those visions you""ve been having? Well, whoever is sending them to you wanted you to meet them here. I""m not sure why, though. I know that only a select few in this world have the power to get here. Right now, we""re here using my powers, but I""m not sure how long I can keep us in this world. Man... whoever called you here must have great powers, considering they""ve been calling you for a while, now."" Zidane thought about Eiko""s words. ""The Mists of Avalon, huh? I""m not sure what this place is all about, but I have a feeling that whoever it is that""s callings us here probably doesn""t have much time. Come on, let""s have a look around this place. We""re bound to find whoever it is that""s looking for us, eventually."" Eiko nodded her head. ""Right."" ""Ohhh... the nerve of her! Daring to defy me, Queen Brahm! Ohhh..."" Brahm/General Beatrix paced the lower dungeons. Besides the occasional skittering of some mice, the dungeon was usually pretty quite. The kingdom of Alexandria was usually a peaceful one, so the dungeons were never used that often. ""I cannot believe her! Freeing Akio from my control. Well at least she hasn""t freed Beatrix yet. This body is still of use to me."" Brahm""s wicked laugh echoed throughout the dungeon halls. Brahm/Beatrix smiled as she approached one of the lower cells. ""You better enjoy the time spent with Zidane in Avalon, because the next time you see him, it will be your last."" The silver haired person stirred, before lying still upon the floor once again. Queen Brahm""s laughter was the only sound that could be heard, echoing off of the stone walls. ""Are we there yet?"" Eiko scowled. ""What kind of question is that? You""re the one who has business to take care of here, not me."" Zidane laughed. ""I""m sorry, Eiko. I couldn""t resist. But... how long do you think it""s been, anyways? I mean, does time even pass the same as in our world, in Alexandria castle?"" ""I think time passes faster here. One hour in Avalon would probably translate to almost five minutes in our time."" ""So... how long have we been walking around in this forest?"" Eiko thought about it for a moment before answering. ""I""d say... about 20 minutes. Four hours if you want Avalon time."" ""Has it really been only twenty minutes?"" Eiko stopped, looking at Zidane. ""Didn""t I just say that it""s been almost four hours Avalon time? Sheesh."" With that, Eiko turned her back to Zidane. Zidane hung his head, and turned around. ""Alright, alright already. I get it, I get it. I won""t say anything else about the time."" Eiko smiled and turned around. ""Better. Now, let""s get moving."" Eiko started ahead of Zidane, continued through the mists. Zidane followed her, but muttered under his breath.",583994
3714,"Part of him wanted to stay behind and sleep in his cab rather than in a bed. But he knew he couldn""t let Olivia face the danger they might be in alone. She was still new and his recruit. It was his duty to guide and teach her. Until the time came for her to be on her own and doing her own missions. He was hoping that would take a while, but he feared she would learn quickly. She was already proving to have a natural aptitude for it. Wanting to get her permission before reaching the front desk, he said to her, ""I think it would be best to get one room with two beds, that way one of us can always watch the auction house for any suspicious activity."" ""That sounds logical,"" she sounded oddly disappointed. ""We could get two rooms,"" Jacques"" stomach tightened at the prospect, but he refused to look too deeply into why. ""Oh, no,"" Olivia replied quickly. ""One room is fine. One room is perfect."" She was blushing again, Jacques noticed. He agreed though, he wanted one room as well. They walked up to the front desk and the clerk greeted them with a smile. ""Can I help you?"" ""Yes,"" Jacques answered. ""We need a room with two beds that faces the street."" That way one of them would be able to watch the parking lot to see if anyone left. The clerked nodded, his smile still on his face as he punched something into his computer. He sighed. ""I""m afraid we""re sold out of rooms of that kind. All we have left is a one bed room that faces the street."" Jacques hesitated to answer, but Olivia spoke up for him. She took the card out of his hand to plop it on the desk. ""We""ll take it."" He raised an eyebrow at her, surprised by her forwardness. It wasn""t so long ago she""d been chastising him for being a strange man asking her to get into his cab. She didn""t look ashamed or embarrassed though as the clerk ran their card. She leaned in to whisper an explanation to him. ""If one of us is keeping watch anyway, we don""t really need two beds."" He nodded. She was right. Though spending a night with Olivia Caliban made him feel unsettled. He wasn""t sure why. He""d spent plenty of nights on mission with beautiful women. It had always stayed professional, as he was a reliable, dependable volunteer. So why did it matter with this recruit? Why did it feel like his stomach was full of eels, writhing and turning at the thought of being alone in a hotel room with only one bed? The clerk handed him his credit card back. ""You""re all set, Mr. and Mrs. Snicket. I hope you enjoy your stay. Do you want us to take your bags for you?"" Jacques bent down to carry his duffle bag with their spying equipment. ""That won""t be necessary. Thank you."" He tried not to think about the assumption that they were husband and wife. He knew it would be best, a good cover that didn""t draw any undue attention to them. It was for the best, he knew. But when Olivia smiled at him in the elevator, the thought of calling her Mrs. Snicket made Jacques"" stomach twist further. They were about to share a private room together with one bed. Jacques swallowed. When the elevator doors closed he reminded himself of the mission.",1497577
1886,"His lips brushed over her cheek and sought her mouth. The kiss was sweet and tender, none of them being in the mood for great passion. It wouldn""t have been the right moment for it, anyway. What they both needed right now was to find warmth and consolation in each other, not desperate passion. Tony hoped that Michelle would feel the same way. At least she did not seem to have any objections, for her lips parted softly under his, making him understand that he was not crossing any borders. She raised one hand and gently put it over his, which was still resting against the side of her face, softly caressing her cheek. The kiss seemed to last forever, and only very reluctantly did Tony allow their lips to part again. For one more moment he remained bent over her and placed another soft kiss on her mouth, then he slowly straightened. ""Do your best, Michelle,"" he said hoarsely. Michelle nodded without speaking, but the look she gave him went straight through his heart. No, she definitely was not mad at him for kissing her like that. There was gratitude in that look, relief, affection, and even a slight hint of optimism. Tony caressed her cheek one more time, smiled at her, and then took his crutches in order to continue his walk around the rooms. From the corner of his eye, he noticed that Carrie was looking over from her own working station. He coldly returned her gaze and noticed with some satisfaction that Carrie blushed and lowered her eyes, pretending to be very busy. Very good, thought Tony. Why shouldn""t she see that her little intrigue had failed completely? Everything was blurring before Michelle""s eyes. She had to refocus every twenty seconds at the latest, careful to pay attention to every little symbol on the screen. But it was getting harder and harder. Thirty minutes had passed since Tony had stopped by her working station, and he had not returned yet. Michelle tried to ban those thoughts from her mind, but the truth was that she longed for another moment like that: A genuinely affectionate gesture that helped her endure this, the longest day of her entire life. ""Come on, girl,"" she muttered through clenched teeth. ""Find something. Anything."" She concentrated on the screen again, and therefore got a terrible shock when someone suddenly appeared behind her. Half expecting to see Tony, she turned around, but her smile froze on her lips. It wasn""t Tony, it was Carrie. ""What""s wrong?"" Michelle asked after she had recovered from the shock. ""I""m taking a break,"" said Carrie. ""I""ll be back in fifteen minutes."" Michelle frowned. ""I cannot allow you more than ten minutes for a break. You know it""s a matter of life and death. I""m sorry."" ""Oh,"" said Carrie, ""I see. Of course. It""s only the one who sleeps with the boss who gets more time."" Michelle looked at her sharply. ""I don""t know what you mean,"" she said stiffly. Carrie smiled. It was an unpleasant smile. ""Stop denying it, Michelle,"" she said. ""I""ve seen you and Tony. Twice."" ""So you have,"" said Michelle.",240213
2112,"I am too! Anyways, this is where we let the fans ask you via this huge screen here. I""ll read you the questions and you answer. Like I said, if it gets too personal, just simply skip to the next question. Hiro: All right. AniUniverse: (presses the button and pops the first question) All righty...this first question is from httydforevergirl. It reads; a lot of fanmade pictures made you addicted to poptarts. Do you actually like poptarts? Hiro: Uh...they""re okay. But I don""t really eat those that much. AniUniverse: Okay then. It""s cool, I like poptarts too. (chuckles) Next question is from...(pushes the button and another question pops up) Midnight Dragon Conquerer...Do you have a crush on GoGo Tomaga? Hiro: (widens eyes) Um...we""re just friends. AniUniverse: You know that when you say that, a lot of people will assume that you do. But we""ll just leave that where it is. Hiro: Thanks. AniUniverse: Next up...(presses the button with another question) from DiamontStar...was Honey your brother Tadashi""s girlfriend? Hiro: Not that I know of. I don""t think my brother dated her. AniUniverse: Okay then. Who""s next...(pushes button and another question pops up) Two questions from RandomChick; first one is maybe you""re going through puberty, but what you hit your growth spurt yet? Hiro: (silent) Next question. AniUniverse: Good call, dude. Second question is...what do you think and what was it like when you first met your team? Hiro: Much better question. Um...it was amazing and not to mention awesome at the same time. When I first met them in my brother""s school, they were pretty cool with me and I never actually thought that we""d actually end up being a superhero team. But it""s awesome. AniUniverse: Top man. (pushes the button for the next question) This next one is from HighCrest Tomoko...is your intelligence too much to match mine? My IQ is in the 1000""s. Audience: Ooooooohhhhhhhh... Hiro: Name the time and place and we""ll see how who""s IQ is much better. Audience and AniUniverse: OH, SNAP! AniUniverse: Okay...moving on. (pushes the button for another question) Dragon Faller asks how did it feel losing Tadashi? Hiro: (sighs) That""s actually one of my least favorite questions to ask. It actually hurt me that I lost Tadashi...someone that I admire, look up to and learn from. We may get on each other""s nerves and all...but he""s been the only family I had...besides Aunt Cass. AniUniverse: We""re very sorry for your loss, dude. Wanna go to another question? Hiro: Yeah, I""d appreciate that. AniUniverse: (pushes the button for another question) This next one is from...gxfan537. How cool is it to work on Microbots? Hiro: Much cool. Because it can transform into anything in your command, whether it""s objects, person or anything else. AniUniverse: I want one of those microbots, dude. Next question is from...(pushes the button and another question pops up) pickleball6 and it""s got a lot of questions. I don""t know if you would like to answer all these, but I""ll read them anyway. Has Baymax ever rocked you while playing a lullaby? Do you speak Japanese?",1276465
2780,"Girlman then says, ""You""ll never get away with this!"" Miss Freeze then says coldly, ""Button up Girlman. A storm is coming."" Then before Miss Freeze can fire at the rest of Girlman, Akane then performs a high jump kick and it somehow cracks the back of Miss Freeze""s suit, and then she opens up her thermos and she says, ""Kasumi says this will get rid of a cold, how about THIS cold!"" And she pours it at the hole she made in the armor, thus weakening Miss Freeze. Girlman then manages to get his feet out of the ice and he throws his ""girl-bolas"" at Miss Freeze and places the ""girl-cuffs"" on her wrists, just to make sure Miss Freeze becomes immobilized just in case the police arrive, after that he takes Freeze""s freeze gun for testing and analysis back in the Girlcave. Girlman then says, ""I guess she""s going to the ""cooler"". oh and thank you Miss Tendo."" Akane then says while smiling, ""You""re Welcome and thanks for saving my father and everyone, but where did Ranma go?"" Girlman then says, ""Umm...I last saw Ranma was trying to go after Ryoga Cobblepot, now that both of them aren""t here what are you going to do with the money now?"" Akane then says, ""I will use it how it was meant to be used, make sure those performers stay rehabilitated, now tell me, who are you and why..."" Then Akane notices Girlman vanished but then Ranma Saotome comes running towards her. Akane then says, ""Ranma! I was so worried about you, where did you go and why is there a cut on your arm unless..."" Ranma then says, ""Nevermind that...who is that?"" Ranma and Akane then see a strange girl in a cat costume trying to make off with some of the charity money and then the strange girl only grabs $500 and then she runs off into parts unknown. Akane then says, ""What""s up with the costumed menaces in Gotham Ward? I""m glad we have Girlman on our side trying his or her best to keep this city clean, but still Ranma why do you have a cut on your left arm?"" Ranma then says, I tripped...now anyway back to the mansion, I will have Kasumi prepare your room while I treat this cut. Kasumi then drives her car to the ice rink to pick up Ranma and Akane while the police apprehend Miss Freeze and thaw Soun Tendo out of the ice (he""s ok readers!). (Meanwhile at Cobblepot Manor) Ryoga gets the news about the incident at the Ice rink and then he shouts at the Kabuki Twins, ""DRAT! Not only Miss Freeze failed me and Girlman made sure the money was safe and ended up being used for those celebritys...but a strange girl in a cat costume made off with some of that charity money and I didn""t hire her! Next time I shall either find another criminal to perform another heist or perhaps I shall handle things myself and make a name for the criminal underworld and that name is not Ryoga Cobblepot but...THE PIG-UIN!"" And Ryoga makes the laugh like the squawk of a penguin. Pink: (translated) Umm is it worth getting our butts handed to us by Girlman? Link: (translated) first off we never fought that guy and second I don""t think our last jobs as waitresses payed off!",910821
2650,"Yves, this is Jimmy,"" I said and waited for her reaction. Would she even recognize me at once? It didn""t take her as much as a split second; it was almost as if she had been expecting my call. ""Oh, hi,"" she said, and she sounded genuinely delighted. ""Jimmy. How are you doing?"" ""Fine, fine, and you?"" ""Me too."" ""What are you doing right now? Did I disturb you?"" In my mind I was cursing myself. Here I was, doing small talk, although there were so many questions I was burning to ask her. ""Well, not really."" Yves laughed. ""I""m just up to my ears into work. Was just studying an essay about the works of Salvador Dalí; gotta play an art college student for a few weeks. Don""t ask me; it""s a new job."" I promised I wouldn""t interrogate her. ""Where are you?"" I asked. ""New York,"" she answered, and my heart leaped into my throat. ""Really? So am I!"" I burst out. ""Are you?"" Suddenly there was an (ever so light) edge in her voice. It sent little icicles sliding down my spine, and I wondered if I had said anything wrong. ""Yeah, I am,"" I answered. ""And, hey, why don""t we meet up tonight? Have a few drinks somewhere, talk a little?"" ""Well, yeah, maybe,"" she said. ""But I can""t guarantee. I""m leaving town tomorrow afternoon, and I""ve got loads of stuff to do before that. So I really don""t know if I""ll have the time. I""d rather say no, Jimmy. I""m sorry."" My world was crumbling, but I didn""t want her to notice even the slightest thing. ""Well, ""twas just a thought,"" I said. ""After all, it""s been a while. And I was just thinking it would be nice to see you when you""re not, uhm, completely drunk."" Yves laughed. ""Well, you""re right, that""s a good argument,"" she said. ""But honestly, Jimmy, I don""t think it""s gonna work. And I""m sorry, but I gotta hang up now. Don""t have much time."" Every fiber of me wanted to scream, ""Please don""t! "", but the last thing I wanted was Yves thinking I was running after her. If she didn""t have the time to see me, then that was that. I should just accept it. But going on without having sorted things out... I knew that if I couldn""t talk to her soon, and in person, that night would haunt me forever. And I just couldn""t cope. I needed to know. But how could I tell her without creating the impression that I was desperate? The most important thing now was not losing her. If that meant that I simply had to ignore what had happened between us, then OK. But still... there had to be a way for me to let her know I really wanted to see her without scaring her away. ""Jimmy?"" Yves asked. I winced. I hadn""t noticed that I had remained silent for quite a while. ""Still there,"" I said. ""Listen, I really gotta hang up now,"" she said. ""I""ll call you tomorrow, that okay? Maybe I will after all have some time to spare for you."" ""That would be great,"" I said. ""You still have my number?"" Yves hesitated for a moment, then she said, ""Well, yeah, somewhere. But why don""t you just give it to me one more time? I""ll write it down."" ""Alright."" I dictated my cell phone number and my landline, and I heard her pen scratching over paper. ""Got ""em,"" she said.",240213
2107,"She rested her head on his shoulders, her hands tightly clutched on his chest. ""I don""t know how Sofia but I promise I""ll make things work."" He said. Though he said it quietly, his voice was full of determination. As he said those words, he tightened his hold on her, not wanting to let her go. Sofia stood outside the castle""s backyard, where they keep their derby-horses. She was patiently waiting for James who had promised to take her out and go sightseeing. According to him, they should have at least a date before his fiancé arrives. As she was glancing around the field, James called out to her while riding his horse. He was grinning as he led his horse towards Sofia. He extended a hand towards her which she eagerly took and then he pulled her up to ride behind him. ""What""s our first stop?"" Sofia asked with a sheepish smile on her face. ""The village. I heard that there""s a festival going on there."" He replied as he started to fly his horse, catching Sofia in surprise and making her hold on to him as tightly as she can. James smiled to himself as he felt her arms immediately wrap around his waist the moment they""re up in the sky. Sofia extended one hand to touch the clouds, with a wide grin plastered in her face. She giggled as she felt the clouds pass through her arm. James, on the other hand, mustered a mischievous smile as he placed both his hands up in the air while laughing. This caught his step-sister in surprise, as the horse suddenly flew down. She hugged James from behind on impulse with her eyes shut close. She didn""t even bother shrieking. James chuckled as he manoeuvred the horse and kept them up in the sky. He turned his head to check on Sofia, who was tightly clutching onto him with eyes closed. He placed a hand on her cheek and gently caressed it with his thumb. Sofia stared up at him and crossed her eyebrows. ""You and your childish pranks, James."" She muttered with a small pout. James laughed once more and pinched her cheek playfully. ""But you had fun. Admit it."" Sofia tried to frown but with James staring at her like that, she couldn""t help but grin at him. ""Fine, fine. I had fun."" She replied, pinching his cheek as well. James gave out another chuckle as he leaned close to her, his thumb slightly grazing her lower lip. She instantly closed her eyes, waiting for his lips to clash with hers. But before that could happen, the horse abruptly flew down once more, interrupting the two from their little moment. James hurriedly manoeuvred the horse and kept their balance. He sighed in relief and kept both his hands on the horse. ""The next time we kiss, let""s do it on the ground and not on a horse flying up in the sky, huh?"" he said with a sheepish smile. Upon reaching the village, James landed the horse softly on the ground, making a soft ""thud"" noise. He first jumped down his horse, and then offered a hand towards Sofia. She took it, and then James gently pulled her towards him. She let out a small gasp as she almost lost her balance but James caught her smoothly, his arms wrapping around her securely. ""You okay?"" he asked. ""Yeah.",2750536
274,"Everything it touched was drained of it""s colors, and it was rumored that all people caught in the darkness became either monsters or animals. And the real monsters that emerged, those were horrifying. Black creatures that struck fear in all who were unfortunate enough to come across them. Meanwhile, men of all ages came to the castle, seeking the honor of being Hyrule""s champion. Many came to honestly fight for their land, and others came with hopes of riches, and still many others who thought the title would come with Zelda""s hand in marriage. And as all the men gathered, others in the land said it was useless to have such a contest. These people believed that the Hero of Time would come back again and save the land as before, but they were ignored as dreamers and fools. And any time Zelda came out of her rooms at the castle, she would be seen not in her usual bright dresses of pink and lavender and cream, but cloaked and her head bowed as if in mourning. She was in mourning. Every day brought more terrible news and every night brought the same nightmare she""d had for years, only now it was intensified, and new parts were added to it. Now, whenever the thing called Ganon laughed, the boy she held in her arms would disappear, and before her would be a ravenous wolf, reading itself to attack her. And more than once she would see an imp creature laughing as it rode astride the wolf""s back. Finally, a week passed, and her birthday came. The same day as the altered tournament. Zelda had refused to attend, but her father had looked so distressed when he nearly begged her to come. ""My dear, your sorrow and despair has spread to the people,"" he told her. ""They look to you, their future Queen, for courage and hope."" ""When this evil is so obviously a curse?"" she asked him. ""A curse that I am to be blamed for?"" ""That""s nonsense!"" he exclaimed. ""Who would tell you such a thing?"" ""It""s true!"" she cried. ""Because I caused Mother""s death! Because I am named Zelda! Because I have had only one dream and it foretells our doom!"" ""Dear, that is why so many men have come,"" he said, taking hold of her shoulders. ""They want to defend their homes, our kingdom- you!"" ""They only want the crown!"" she shouted. Her father did not shout or argue. He simply drew her close and hugged her. ""That may be,"" he said softly, ""But they must earn it. Someone will save us,"" he said to her. ""Perhaps... perhaps the Hero of Time will actually come and save us."" This made her laugh a little. If only such could happen. But her hopes were on the person Nayaru had said would come. ""He will be clad in green, and be one with animals...' ""Perhaps,"" Zelda said at last. ""Then come and watch,"" her father asked again. ""Maybe we will both see him, hidden in the contestants."" She grudgingly dressed in her old favorite gown and did as her father asked. She sat beside his seat in the royal box, and watched as the contestants lined up in their horses.",512464
3238,"Kikuchi prayed silently as he eyed Kanzaki. Kanzaki thought for a while. She smiled, ""Perhaps this will work."" By this, she faced Kikuchi and tiptoed, her lips brushing gently on his. - To Be Continued... So what do you think? Please Review! I""m evil, I know! Muwhahahahahaha!

Miriae Okay, I""m still alive -Showers cookies to all readers- You guys rock! Thank you very much for the 100+ reviews! waaaaah! Please accept these cookies! s Chapter 6 A boy and a girl s Kanzaki. A simple kiss. These were the words the echoed through Kikuchi""s mind as he stared into empty space, also known as the ""corridor, walking as slow as he can. It was one of those moments when he was rendered speechless, his brain processing fell down sharply and his mind screamed for explanations. He nearly crashed through a poor student who carried a stack of books. He felt like tripping a number of times. Definitely, it was dangerous. But, like what was said, he really wasn""t in the mood to think logically. A few moments ago, Kanzaki kissed him. It wasn""t exactly a kiss... physically speaking, it was just a moment of contact between the skin of their lips that didn""t even last for two seconds... Two seconds... that was quite fast but at that moment, time stopped. He could feel like puking. His thoughts were being contaminated by sloppy, mushy ones... definitely, something""s wrong with him today. But deep in his mind, he knew that he enjoyed that contact. Admit it, Kikuchi, you""re falling head-over-heels with your greatest rival s The sight that greeted her would have been placed in the Guinness Book of Records: The longest time a crowd held their breath. Maybe it was exaggeration but that""s just how she saw it. The crowd was silent, nothing could be heard. It was just like a scary movie when the main character had her senses rocketed up high, anticipating for the appearance of the monster. She flashed the jaw-dropped crowd an innocent smile. She advised Kikuchi to leave a few moments ago to avoid a bloody combat... even though she knew that to avoid such sight, she should have been the one who left. But Kanzaki liked thrill. And definitely, she wasn""t backing out on this one. ""I""m really sorry for that... umm... public display of affection. That""s the only proof I could think off, you know,"" she silently congratulated herself for the stunt she pulled. Poor Onizuka, you hadn""t witnessed one of most daring stunts Kanzaki Urumi has pulled in her life. Sayuri shut her jaw and opened it again.",560480
3706,"That had been her main argument against Bailey, but it didn""t matter because the argument was against Bailey. Even though it was a good argument as her bringing back Shepherd was doomed to fail. She saw this even more clearly now as she had another beer. You don""t send a person to bring someone back from the abyss who barely knows them; you""ll just wind up losing two people to the abyss. Especially when the person you send out is dealing with a divorce, a dump, and a confusing peds surgeon. Callie should""ve never been sent out into the woods. She was not a woods girl. Now, if had been Mark Sloan she might have been able to do something. In fact, why didn""t anyone think to send him? Fight or no fight, he was the best friend and this definitely fell into the best friend job category. There were so many who would""ve been better for this task. But as she cracked another beer and smiled slightly at his last comment and looked at Shepherd out of the corner out her eye, she realized something. She was beginning to know Derek, the man. Owen was aware of how much he was drinking. There was no denying that Shepherd""s words had affected him, spoken with just a little too much truth. He called himself a ghost and Shepherd had called him dead inside, which were essentially the same thing. It""s why he""d accepted the beer silently and commiserated with a different sort of comrades than he was used to, but he knew well enough not to drink too much. He was still a man on a mission after all, and he would not return to the hospital until he brought back Doctor Shepherd. He wasn""t lying when he told Bailey that he could, and he was determined to keep it that way. It was just taking longer than he expected. He needed to stay sharp and aware, ready to drive back. So he watched how much he drank. That, and, he worried about just how much of his guts he would spill to these people. Especially considering what happened the last time he got drunk. He wasn""t desperate to explain himself and secure a second chance (and another date) with Derek Shepherd; it was also why he got a different heartbreaking story. It was only thing to wallow over surgeries gone wrong, quite another to break down completely over surgeons and soldiers alike blowing up in front of his eyes. He wasn""t lying when he told Shepherd that he didn""t talk about Iraq either. He couldn""t afford to break, and being around a man who had gone over an edge he spent his life in the after flirting with as much as a certain resident was making this the kind of dangerous mission he once loved. So Owen Hunt watched what he drank. After the Chief followed Shepherd inside the trailer, Owen knew it was time to leave. He looked at his watch for the first time since arriving and was immediately brought to his feet by the time. He""d already missed Sloan""s face transplant, and would soon miss Cristina""s solo surgery as well. Damn it. He looked at his drinking buddy for the past few hours, she was looking out into the woods with the dazed stupor only the drunk and high could pull off. ""Torres.""",1497577
256,"Here she stood at the foot of her bed in the barracks, a letter specifically addressed out to her sitting in her hands. It proved it all, it proved how horrible of a man he was. Who was she to think that he was different? It read: Nya Fateze It is with great sorrow that I regret to inform you that you are to be honorably discharged from your duties in Hydra. You have failed to meet the requirements that come with your position. We will be looking for other more suitable candidates at this time. Lieutenant General Johann Schmidt She was frozen for an instant, her hands tense and her mind blank. Then suddenly a whirl of anger rushed through her bones. Red. It was all she could see, endlessly flowing through veins and pumping across her heart, clouding her vision. She crumbled up the paper and threw it across the barracks, standing immediately she sped herself in the direction of his office. I couldn""t let him do this! And with a letter?! Of all things! When she made it to his door, she felt hesitant. She felt his breath at her throat, his image in her mind, and it overwhelmed her. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, turning the metal handle to the door she swung it open. She was met with the sight of Johann Schmidt and his closest scientist, they were staring at a blue cube of light. He turned to face her, his mask creasing over his features. ""Something wrong, Ms. Fateze?"" Zola peaked out behind him. ""Should I leave?"" Zola asked in fear. ""No, of course not Doctor. Please continue your work."" ""Zola."" Fateze snapped, Zola stopped completely. ""Leave before I kill you."" Schmidt""s gaze visibly darkened, the irritation obvious in it. Zola swiftly left the room, hoping to evade the cross fire. He stepped passed her and out the door, she slammed it shut behind her. Her fists clenched at either side of her and she shook her head. ""I hate you."" Her voice wavered, her expression softening. She was cracking and Schmidt could see it. ""You don""t sound very convincing."" ""You are a coward! How could you dismiss with a piece of paper you..."" Her works broke out into German obscenities, her eyes squinted and she started to cry. She placed her hands over her face to hide her cries, but it was no use. ""It had to be done! Besides this had gone too far."" He interrupted her, she closed the distance between them and in her anger slammed a hand against his chest. ""You were the one that started the sex!"" He remained unfazed, she caught herself before she pushed him too far, but perhaps she had already gone too far. ""Wrong!"" He yelled. ""We both initiated this."" ""I love you!"" She screamed out, his eyes widened and he took a step away in surprise. She shook her head and crossed her arms. ""I wished I didn""t, but I have never been with a man like you before. I have never felt like this before. Then you send me a ficken piece of paper."" She straightened herself up and pointed a finger in his face. ""It is one thing to dismiss me from Hydra, an entirely different thing when you don""t tell me to my face.""",6234395
1727,"""I know you think-"" ""You know nothing, Jon,"" I shook my head. His eyes widened and shoulders slumped, as if the words affected him somehow, ""If you thought I would jump for joy when you mentioned courting me officially, you know nothing. It scares me, Jon."" I leaped forward and snatched his hand. Thrusting it against my bosom, I held it there so he could feel how my heart was racing. And I was scared. The mere thought of having that much power, and all the knives at my back that meant, frightened me, ""I didn""t go to King""s Landing to charm myself a husband. I went to know my Father. And I found many friends, and..."" I bit my lip and dropped his hand, looking away out a window as a raven cried in the distance, ""I guess you could say I found love there too."" ""Synne-"" ""Let""s say we courted. No, let""s say we found a septon drunk enough to bless a marriage between the King and a low-raised bastard,"" I crossed my arms, shoulders hunched and still looking away from him, ""There would be talk, scheme""s, maybe even attempts on both our lives. Sansa is targeted for daring to lead the North as a woman. How much better would a bastard Queen fair?"" ""You seemed fine with being my... my mistress,"" Jon spat the word, ""But not my Queen. You would be the most heavily protected woman in Westeros. No one would harm you or dare say a word."" ""You can""t stop people from talking and plotting,"" I said, ""My father couldn""t protect my mother. She died with only me beside her, after a life of hard labor, forced prostitution, beatings and rape. All because she dared to love and hope above her station."" I took his hand in mine and squeezed, staring at our entwined fingers, ""I said I would always come back to you, stay by your side, and I will. But please... don""t make me into something I""m not, and let it destroy us both."" ""I ""ave seen the trust and noblest of men come from the humblest beginnings, and monsters among Queens and Kings,"" Jon brought my hand up to his lips and kissed the knuckle, smiling though his expression looked strained, ""You""re better than you realize, and with less to fear, Synne Sand."" ""No, no, I""m really not,"" It took me an embarrassingly long time to tear my eyes from his warm stare, ""I am just a bastard who is good with animals."" ""You treated me as anyone else from the day I found you with Ghost in the Godswood,"" Jon said, ""As if I wasn""t the King, but just some random person who insulted you."" It seemed like so long ago now, that night in the Godswood. I barely remembered that he""d insulted me at all, though in hindsight the comment seemed much more a slight against himself than me, ""So?"" ""When Drogon attacked the feeder and injured you, I felt like back when I watched Ygritte die in my arms,"" Jon looked down the hall both ways before yanking me towards him by the hand. Ygritte? ""I tried to keep my distance because I would not go through that again. But... what were your words? Gods as my witness, I can""t."" ""Jon... don""t, please,"" His hands were so warm, like a hearth fire. Warm and... inviting.",748687
1837,"Alucard remained completely silent. A sly grin etched on his features. In his own mind, he was getting revenge on the cabal of vampires who put him on the throne in the first place. He was the goddamn Sacred Ancestor. There were no predecessors to him; answerable to no one and about as vile as they came. He was violent, sado-masochistic, misogynistic, racist, jealous and proud of it. He was a petty, unjust, unforgiving control freak with homophobic, genocidal, filicidal, capriciously malevolent tendencies. And he was also a bully. If he could get away with it, he would feed the same poison to everyone in the audience and then see how they cheered. But then there would be nobody to glorify him. A new creature stepped on stage and joined the youth with a spider head sticking out of his gut. This was a tall, feminine shape with the bald head of a vulture. Pulling out two stands of silver coated barbed wire, the Vulture-woman and the Spider-boy each grabbed a strand and started to use it to floss the crotch of a female vampire that Seras did not recognize. Her features were turning green; she was going to be sick. The female vampire shrieked as her labia and clitoris was shredded like sliced meat by the back and forth motion of silver coated razor wire. Jan was really getting frantic now. He was threatening and crying like a baby in equal turns. Approaching him was bandaged figure which dripped slime from under his mummy like wrappings and cradles a purring chainsaw in its mottled, deformed hands. Seras couldn""t watch anymore and went to leave since she would play no greater part in this satanic farce. She sprinted down the deserted hallways, realizing now was her time to flee. The prospect of freedom was terrifying. There was nowhere to go and no time to pack anything of significance before Alucard""s address of his people was over. That was when the first explosion happened. She didn""t see it but she felt it. Somewhere in Alucard""s underground lair, a bomb went off and it caused shockwaves through the place. The rumble in the floor caused Seras to trip and fall. Shocked by the fall, Seras dimly was aware of when the Jackal fell from her hidden holster and slid across the floor. While she wasn""t willing to wait for time to pick up any of her good, Seras wasn""t going to leave without her gun. More shockwaves rocked everything and caused dust to fall from the ceiling. A hundred pound chunk of concrete fell from the ceiling but Seras easily knocked it aside. Grabbing her weapon from the floor, Seras began to run with increased urgency. Behind her, explosions tore apart the hallway. She felt the heat of the flames and knew that she didn""t want to be anywhere near here if one of those explosions went off near Alucard""s central armoury. Distant bombs detonating went off and caused Seras""s sensitive vampire ears to ring-then she hit something hard and unyielding. Falling backwards, Seras drew her gun and aimed it at whatever or whoever she""d run into. Dust had fallen into her eyes and as she tried to blink it out, she heard a voice.",1220273

As Junior walks backwards, he bumps into something and when he turns around, he sees what appears to be a centaur with the head of a lion and is armed with a sword. Junior then screams, ""A LYNEL! AAAAAHHHHH!"" as he runs away in pure fear. Junior continues to run as the Lynel chases after him, Junior then thinks to himself, ""I thought Lynels are from Hyrule, umm I mean Edna""s ""Zelda"" video game, how did one end up in Somewhere?"" The Lynel then starts chasing Junior and manages to grab him. As the Lynel is about to attack him with his sword, an iron arrow hit the monster in the back, then three more iron arrows strike him more and then it evaporates into black dust. Junior studies the arrows and notices they are made of iron and he thinks to himself, ""Iron Arrows? Now who else do I know besides myself and Shirley that knows how to vanquish monsters easily?"" Junior turns around and sees what looks like a female anthropodmorphic pig in a grey and green European dress, her hair is in a braided black pony tail and she looks very angry. She takes the monster""s sword and says, ""So it""s you dog! We meet again!"" Courage Jr. flashes back to chapter 14... ((As the ""The catgirls who say Nya"" ruin the show while Izzy and Manta watch, Courage Jr. opens Benton Tarentella""s office as he shouts out, ""You""re not going to get away with this you zombie...huh?"" Then Junior sees piles of dust in a trailer and it leads to a mysterious figure smashing Benton""s bones into dust with it""s iron hammer. As it turns to look at Junior, she looks like a female anthropodmorphic pig in a grey and green European dress, her hair is in a braided black pony tail and she looks very angry. She tells Junior, ""I didn""t do this to help you, I swear I will destroy every monster in this City and I don""t need you in my way."" With that she throws a tiny ball, spewing white smog as she vanishes from sight. What was left was the head of Benton Tarentella, coughing from the smog.)) As The girl pulls out her sword, Junior turns his ocarina into a baton and soon the two clash their weapons together. Junior then asks, ""Who are you, why are you attacking monsters, and why are you so angry!"" The girl knocks the Ocarina off Junior""s paw and draws her sword near Junior""s nose. She says to him, ""The name""s Sonia and it""s my destiny to destroy every supernatural being I see and I""m angry at you because of your father young Courage Junior!"" Junior shivers in fear and asks, ""Are you one of dad""s enemies?"" Sonia then scoffs the comment and says to him, ""I have no time to deal with you, just stay out of my way and you won""t get hurt...much!"" Junior shivers at the comment but cannot help wondering why she hates his father and supernatural beings as he picks up his ocarina. Sonia then tells Courage Jr. ""Well before I go, I must tell you that the weird club in Somewhere is going out with a ""bang""! Hmm hmm hmmmmm.""",910821
1284,"Ulrich casually stroked it a few times, considering what to do next. His original plan had been to tie William up, with decorative knots and rope-play, before his plans changed to breaking in his new whip. Yet, judging by the time on his watch, he had just spent an inordinately long amount of time on it and Yumi was due to meet them soon. This was not how he wanted Yumi to see William. He looked around the scene then down at his cock and an idea struck him. Ulrich dug around his bag until he pulled out a padded leather blindfold and looked back at his submissive. ""Ulrich,"" William said softly. Ulrich looked up in surprise. He hadn""t commanded William to do that. William hadn""t made any other moves, but Ulrich had made up his mind. ""Are you ready for showtime, my sweet William?"" Ulrich had told Jeremie about his meeting with Yumi earlier in the week. ""I can""t tell her what it is I..."" Ulrich hesitated, searching for the right words. ""Me and William... she needs to understand. She deserves to know the truth. I""m going to show her the truth."" Jeremie had argued against it, but in the end, Ulrich""s reasoning won. ""I care about her too much and she won""t understand if she doesn""t see for herself..."" Ulrich had shaken his head. ""She won""t believe me."" ""She might not understand,"" Jeremie warned. ""She might not speak to you again. What happens then? What happens to us? The Lyoko Warriors?"" Ulrich shrugged. ""We have our duties to defeat X.A.N.A. but we can""t let him stop us from living our lives. Whether this happens now or later... it""ll hurt more if I keep dragging her along. These feelings. The truth."" ""Why are you telling me?"" Jeremie had asked. ""I""m not the best person when it comes to helping others with their emotional problems. Why not Aelita or..."" Jeremie had almost said Odd then, but quickly stopped short. Because the notion of Odd being sensitive and caring was ridiculous. They were not exactly Odd""s forte. Or in Odd""s vocabulary. ""It has to be you,"" Ulrich said, looking Jeremie in the eyes. ""You may not have realized it but Yumi, she-"" When Ulrich didn""t continue, Jeremie had prodded his friend. ""Yumi what?"" Ulrich had shaken his head. ""Nothing. You""ll see; you both will."" He had been told the time and place. ""She""ll definitely be there,"" Ulrich told him. ""It""s one of Yumi""s favorite places to go when she""s upset or troubled."" Jeremie had briefly thought of following her to her meeting with Ulrich, but whatever Ulrich had planned, it was for her eyes only. ""And William?"" Jeremie asked Ulrich. Ulrich had given Jeremie a lopsided smile. ""He won""t be present either. It""ll be just me and Yumi."" ""Have you ever made him suppress his memory before?"" Jeremie inquired. With that, Ulrich laughed heartily. ""You think I would spring this on William and expect him to be okay with it? Even he has limits, you know."" ""And if you""re wrong? What if she isn""t there?"" Jeremie said, changing to subject. ""She will be,"" Ulrich said. ""How do you know?"" After a beat of silence, Ulrich spoke up. ""Because it""s the place we first met.""",583994
2380,"It sounded as if a tree itself had spoken. ""Hi Grandpa,"" Magnus said casually. ""Magnus, my lad. You hardly come to see your old grandfather. To what do I owe the pleasure of your company this fine evening?"" the Elf Lord asked. ""We have come on a quest,"" Magnus said, sitting on the floor at his Grandfather""s side. ""Is it the same quest to find your father?"" his Grandfather asked. ""No,"" Magnus answered, ""A new one, on behalf of all Lodoss. I come with my friends, Princess Gemini of Flaim, and her warriors, my old friend Elska, Maar, and Prince Orson of the Dragon Riders. We are on our way to Marmo, to defeat the Sorcerer Knight."" ""An old quest mingled with a new?"" the Elf king asked. ""Come, you must tell me more, my grandson, and I swear that if I or any of our kin can help you, we shall."" They sat around a large feasting table, and there, Magnus and Gerrek explained to the Elf King about the prophecy, and the Sorcerer Knight""s ambition, and earlier attack. ""I do not understand,"" Deedling said, ""these creatures, though ordered to kill you, seemed to make no resistance when you fought them."" ""That""s been troubling me ever since we left the desert,"" Greebus said. ""Though I am confident we travel with Myre""s blessing, the opposition should have been far more difficult."" ""Perhaps this Sorcerer only wished to distract you, so that he might attack the Princess Directly."" the Elf King said. ""But why?"" Magnus asked. ""For his scheme to work, the Princess has to sing. Why would he attack her?"" ""Probably to make her mind weaker,"" Ryna suggested. ""I""ve seen Karla at work. She and this Sorcerer probably know about Gem""s strong mind, and stubborn will. Maybe they""re trying to break her spirit so Karla can take control of her more easily."" ""We can""t let that happen!"" Maar cried. He looked to the Princess with sad eyes. ""We know Maar,"" Gerrek said, ""We""ll just have to up the security around Gemini."" Gem shook her head, and looked at Gerrek sternly. Then, Magnus spoke for her, saying, ""She doesn""t want to be babied. Gem wants to be able to fight the Knight on her own."" ""But what if he captures her?"" Leaf asked, concerned for her young friend. ""That""s a chance she""s willing to take?"" Magnus said. ""She wants to do her father proud. Show that his house is still strong."" ""Then she will make a fine queen, for your human kingdom,"" Magnus""s grandfather said, with a merry booming laugh. ""Now, away with these troublesome matters. Let us eat, drink, and be merry this night."" As the Elf musicians struck up a jolly chord, Princess Gemini gave a thought to her Mother and Father. She wondered where they were right now. If they were safe. If they knew she was safe. Transition Queen Neese looked to the far south, along the long river that led to Kannon, and then to the island of Marmo. Her daughter was on her way to that island. That island, and possibly the castle, that still haunted her nightmares. ""Neese?"" Spark asked her quietly, as he came up beside her. ""What""s wrong?"" ""Oh, nothing,"" Neese said, hoping to mask her anxiety. ""I know you better than that,"" Spark said.",512464

(screen spins) Girlman and Tomboy are in the Girlmobile while Boygirl is on her motorcycle but then they see a bat-themed car and two very familiar looking characters. The young boy in that car says, ""Holy mirror mirror Batman! those two look kinda like us!"" Then Batman says, ""What are you doing here?"" Girlman responds, ""I might ask you the same question."" Batman responds, ""Pursuing the enemies of law and order, wherever they happen to be. Well, I don""t want to hold you up from your crimefighting."" Tomboy then says, ""Thank you. And good luck to you, Mister Batman."" Robin replies ""Nice to have met you."" Batman then says, ""But since I""m here...can you pass the grey poupon?"" After Girlman hands Batman and Robin a jar of ""grey poupon"" they drive away on the bat-mobile, Tomboy asks Girlman, ""Gosh, Girlman, what are they dressed like that for?

Carmen watched Harrison sadly, lately she was always feeling bad for Harrison, it just didn""t seem fair that Harrison would never be able to have the person he loved, it just wasn""t fair, but a lot of things weren""t fair in life. ""Harrison calm down, it""s just that you know Sam better then anyone"" Brooke nodded. Nicole remained quiet. Mary Cherry watched him in awe. Josh lowered his eyes. Sugar Daddy took a bite of his food. ""I used to know Sam better then anyone! Used being the keyword here! I don""t know Sam.... not anymore"" Harrison went to pick up his lunch but just slammed it back down on the cafeteria table making his friends jump back in surprise, Harrison pushed himself up and walked out of the cafeteria bumping into Sam on his way out. ""Hey Harris---"" Sam stopped short of her sentence when she saw the look on Harrison""s face, it was one of anger and sadness and then to make things even more worse Harrison pushed his way past Sam, he didn""t even look back, it was like he had walked right through her, like she didn""t mean a thing to him. ""Here"" Sam shoved her plate of food to April Tuna and took after Harrison. ""Harrison! Harrison!"" Sam pushed her way through the crowd of teenagers who were busily chatting about various things--- things that varied to ramblings about who was better for Joey... Dawson or Pacey to the latest fashion news---- Sam rolled her eyes and continued to push her way through the crowd, she had to catch up with Harrison, she had to find out what was bothering him. Harrison had just pushed right past her, he had never done something like that, was he mad at her? And if so, what about? ""Besides the obvious"" Sam pushed through the last bit of the crowd and rushed out of the school, she let her brown eyes skim every possible inch of the outside area of the school, her eyes stopped when she saw Harrison sitting under a weepy and big oak tree. Sam heaved a heavy sigh, she brushed back the loose strands of her hair that fell in front of her eyes--- she continued to stare at Harrison, she really didn""t know what to do, she had this huge urge in her heart to run over to him and take his body in her arms but she knew that things weren""t that simple anymore, nothing was simple anymore. One confession---- one declaration of love---- changed everything, there was no turning back, Sam couldn""t pretend that Harrison was just her friend---- indeed he was her best friend but he was so much more to her... he was her steady brick wall that helped her be strong when she felt she was weak... he was the shoulder she leaned on... he was her eyes when she was blind... he was her wings that made her fly... could he be *that* to her too?

1988,"Once the kitchen was cleaned up and dishes washed, they""d gone their separate ways. Would they ever be close like that? Would he be willing to take on a pregnant woman, then her child? Would he actually be willing to help her? ""Dawn?"" the nurse called. She closed her magazine and got up. A few seconds later, the doctor had rubbed the slick stuff on her belly and was running the ultrasound machine. ""Well, the baby looks pretty good,"" she said, ""two arms, two legs, no problems that I can see. Would you like to know the gender now? You haven""t ever asked what it was."" ""Yeah,"" Dawn gave in, ""tell me."" ""It""s a girl."" Dawn smiled. Images of little pink tennis shoes were running through her mind. She could only hope that this baby ended up looking like her. ""Thanks."" She came out of the office feeling as though a weight had been lifted off her chest. She only hoped that nothing would go wrong during the delivery. She was already fairly close; another couple of months would bring the answer. After walking back to the apartment, Dawn straightened a few things up and dusted a little bit. She stretched out onto the couch and flipped on the TV. For a long time, she didn""t see anything that interested her. Then, she came across some old movie. She started to watch it, but she fell asleep. Blackheart came home while she was still out. Something about her made him smile, but he couldn""t figure out what it was. Maybe it was that big belly--even though Dawn was definitely not a lightweight, the round curve of the belly was starting to dwarf the rest of her figure. It was going to be a big baby. Her curls softly framed her oval-shaped face. He brought a blanket and covered her up. Then, he sat down beside her and channel-surfed, letting his mind wander. His new job had been much less taxing on his patience and the pay was three times as much as it had been at the coffee shop. Unless something really went wrong, he, Dawn, and the baby should have a pretty good life together. A load of nervousness filled his stomach. Blackheart realized he had no clue how to take care of a baby. Dawn was fairly easy--everything she needed, she could either get herself or ask for. Hopefully, Dawn would know what she was doing. He wondered exactly how long they were going to be together. He wasn""t objecting to it, but what did mortal couples do, exactly? He had so many questions. And further, how long could he keep the secret from Dawn that he wasn""t exactly born human? Blackheart knew he was going to have to tell her sooner or later, but she""d never believe him. The truth was beginning to sound pretty bizarre even to him. Dawn""s head tilted over and landed on his shoulder. Instinctively, he moved closer to her. Very lightly, he kissed her forehead. Having her this close felt good. After about a half-hour, she stirred awake. Her face was still pale from sleep as her presence slowly reentered her body. She stretched, then rubbed her eyes. ""How was work?"" she asked, her voice still deep and husky from sleep.",870118
3035,"Stayne pinned Um against the wall. The disgust on her face was evident. Aurora also detected a trace of nerves. ""I like you, Um..."" he said huskily, ""I like...largeness..."" Um pushed him back. ""Get away from me!"" she snapped. Aurora heard a chuckle. She saw someone sprinting down the hallway, but she didn""t see who it was. Either way, the air suddenly turned dark and foreboding. The anger was now mixed with nerves. She stalked towards Stayne and grabbed his hand. His expression was pure nastiness. ""What do you want?"" he snapped, obviously angry that he""d been rejected. Aurora glared at him reproachfully. She pointed to the other hallway and did a very exaggerated imitation of one of the court ladies. Then, she pointed at Stayne and the spot that Um had just been standing in. ""Someone saw us?"" he asked. She nodded. It was the first time she""d seen the color drain out of his face the way it did. He scowled, but she could see the fear underneath. A mixture of nerves and loathing made his body stiffen. ""Aurora..."" he couldn""t seem to figure out what he wanted to say, ""...I must ask you not to tell anyone. Can you swear to me that you won""t?"" She nodded. Though she didn""t like the situation, she understood. His ridiculous behavior was pent-up lust and loneliness. Iracebeth was as likely as a porcupine to be his lover. The ladies of the court were too frivolous and gossiped too much. Aurora was the only other woman besides the rest of them that he""d been exposed to and he still treated her as if she wasn""t all there. That left Um as the only candidate...it was in that moment that she despised male logic. ""Thank you,"" he said grudgingly. His pride was hurt, she knew. There were a million things that she wanted to say, but she wasn""t sure she should. He walked away and she followed him. He wasn""t sure whether he minded or not...his intention was to grab some Outlandish wine and get completely smashed. It was about ten times stronger than regular wine. The kitchen was dark, as the servants had finished cleaning up a few hours ago. He went straight to the pantry and retrieved the bottle. ""Don""t look at me like that,"" he said without turning around. He could sense Aurora giving him a Look. When he turned back to look at her, she was conspicuously not looking at him. He retrieved two glasses and sat down at one of the tables. She watched him pour the blood-colored liquid into them. ""If you""re going to stay, then stay. But I""d prefer it if you aren""t completely sober either."" She accepted the glass with some hesitation. He downed the contents quickly. Slowly, she raised the glass to her lips. It wasn""t what she was expecting. She""d only smelled wine one time on the breath of one of the orderlies and it stunk to her...this didn""t have that noxious smell. Instead, it smelled sweet, like fruit juice. She took a cautious sip. It tasted even better than it smelled. It was hard to believe that this drink had any alcohol in it whatsoever. Still, she drank it slowly. Stayne was already on his second glass. ""I hate this place,"" he sighed, ""it""s lonely.",870118
3082,"""So why did you realize you loved me tonight, of all nights?"" he asks. ""Why did you kiss me tonight? I can""t help thinking that kissing a human mouth was what did it for you..."" ""No, Donnie,"" I say. I take his face in my hands again, turn him towards me, and kiss him deeply before I continue. Just as I""m about to pull away, I can feel his shy reaction, his hand floating up to caress my cheek. He is kissing me back, still wary. I pull back gently, letting him keep his hand on my cheek. ""I realized it tonight because when the four of you first entered the room as humans, I didn""t recognize any of your brothers. But as soon as I saw you, it was like some force was pulling me towards you, it was really weird... and then I recognized you. I knew it was you, even though I had no way of knowing, and all the rest of me except my mind recognized you even before that. That""s how I knew. Not because you looked human. But because you looked different and I still knew you. Only you, not the others. So if that doesn""t prove that there""s something really special going on between the two of us, I don""t know what does."" ""April..."" My name drips from his lips like honey. My arms go back around him and I hold him tight. ""I love you, Donatello, you stupid, stubborn, brilliant, sweet, brave..."" ""... mutant,"" he finishes for me. And then he pulls me over so I sit on his lap, and he holds me tight while he kisses me again like there is no tomorrow, and I just want to melt into him. And so I do. Early Morning. The Lair. ""It""s time,"" Leo says, glancing nervously at the clock on the wall. The guys and myself are standing in a circle in their room, huddled together. Donnie and I are clutching each other""s hands. The others have, for some reason, not commented at all about the fact that Donnie and I simply disappeared from the prom and never came back. Miraculously, Mikey doesn""t even seem to have noticed anything at all. He is still in hyper mode, buzzing about, until Leo catches him by the arms and pulls him back into our circle. Raph is looking disheveled, and is that lipstick on his cheek?! Looks like he went off on an adventure of his own. Easy enough, there were many girls checking him out. Leo catches my eye across the circle and gives me a warm smile and a small nod, and I just know that he knows. I clasp Donnie""s hand tighter in reaction and I know Leo sees that, too, and he approves. ""Will it hurt?"" Mikey asks in a small voice. ""The change yesterday hurt."" I look at Donnie. ""You didn""t mention that,"" I say. ""Was it bad, Mikey?"" Mikey nods. Right now he really looks like a little kid. Donnie leaves my side, brushing my hand with his in passing, and hugs Mikey. ""I don""t know if it""s gonna be just as bad,"" he says. ""Maybe it""ll be easier."" ""I didn""t think it hurt too bad,"" says Raph. ""Yeah, because you""re the badass,"" Mikey retorts reproachfully. Leo chuckles. ""Three minutes,"" he says. ""I don""t know about you guys, but I would actually prefer some privacy for the change. So I""m just gonna..."" He points back to where their bunks are and leaves.",240213
2401,"""Aren""t you forgetting something?"" Arthur said this as though he were talking to a five year old child. Merlin""s brow wrinkled in puzzlement. ""My sword!"" ""Oh yeah! Yeah. Sorry. You""ll be needing that,"" Merlin said as he plucked his sword from the rack, kicking himself for being so careless. Arthur snatched his sword and stomped away, red cloak billowing behind him. Well, that went well. Meanwhile, up in the stands, Lara was sitting bolt upright in between next to Gwen, who had saved her a seat, a feeling of anticipation in the pit of her stomach; she felt like she was about to do something important and amazing instead of watching a bloodbath unfold for pure entertainment. She""d never been to a tournament, much less one sponsored by a royal family. According to Gaius, Arthur was the reigning champion, and he""d never lost a swordfight... With a sickening lurch, a horrible thought struck Lara: what if Arthur did lose? Lose his focus or his footing just for one second, and then it would be the end, just like that. No... she thought. Surely it won""t happen... no one would dare hurt the king""s son... Drums sounded out from somewhere, joined by the horns soon after. It was starting! The atmosphere had already been electric with excitement, but now the air itself seemed to be quivering in anticipation. The competitors strode out of a side entrance quietly with determined faces, each believing that they would be the last man standing. As they formed two lines of twelve Lara sat, if possible, a little straighter, straining to see where Arthur was. Oh, there he was- second to last in the second row. He was eyeing a man in yellow robes grimly, seemingly already dreading the fight. Lara""s thoughts were interrupted when Uther swept into the arena. ""Knights of the Realm,"" he boomed, ""it is a great honour to welcome you to the Tournament of Camelot. Over the next three days you will come to put your bravery to the test, your skills as warriors, and of course, to challenge the reigning champion, my son, Prince Arthur."" Arthur shifted uncomfortably from foot to foot as every eye in the place turned to him. She caught his eye and gave him a small smile; he nodded at her in acknowledgement. ""Only one of you can have the honour of being crowned champion, and he will recieve a prize of one thousand gold pieces,"" Uther continued. A woman on the side opened a small chest on a nearby table: the crowd oooohed and ahhhhed at the coins, glinting gold in the sunlight. ""It is in combat that we learn a knight""s true nature- whether he is indeed a warrior, or a coward. The Tournament begins!"" Uther declared, and the crowd burst into applause. The competitors bowed their heads in submission and marched dutifully away, leaving the first two to fight- which, unfortunately, included Arthur. Lara watched with wide eyes as Arthur and his opponent- Lara could not see his face but his robes were brown, so Lara had decided to call him Brownie- unsheathed their swords. Arthur did his famous little twist with it before taking his stance.",2855986

What""s rare is the courage to follow it to the dark places where it leads."" - Erica Jong ""So let me get this straight,"" Tyrion took a generous sip of wine before setting it down. It was just us at the table; the servants were off doing whatever servants do and Bronn preferred the company of the town to that of the castle, ""You got a little stir crazy, went to the Godswood, met the King""s beast, befriended said beast, and possibly offended a nobleman when he called you a bastard?"" I flushed and looked down at my food. I heard him drink more wine, then chuckle, ""You work fast. Try not to alienate every noble in the castle too quickly, Synne.""

He probably didn""t mind. In fact, it was probably refreshing for him."" ""You know him?"" My head shot up, ""Who was he?"" Tyrion placed a stubby finger on his lips, ""You""ll find out."" I glared and he laughed. We ate, then Tyrion stood to excuse himself. I started to gather up the plates - the food was of a simpler type than I""d seen him eating on the way to King""s Landing - and I could tell that it was him trying to ease me into life as a noble bastard. When he saw me cleaning up, he raised an eyebrow, ""If it makes you feel better, but we do have servants for that."" ""Mother always taught me to clean up after myself,"" I said, folding napkins and stacking plates, ""So yes, it does make me feel better."" He hesitated for a moment before shaking his head and taking the center staircase up, probably to his chambers. I tilted my head, thoughtful. In this and my other interactions with Tyrion Lannister, a pattern was emerging. Whenever I brought up something my mother had said or taught me, either shut him up, he would agree, or let me do whatever it was. I wouldn""t abuse it, like making up something she""d said, but still... It was interesting. I woke early the next day, when the sun was just about to rise. I was still on the schedule of a farm girl. Florys stirred next to me in the bed before jumping right on my chest and licking my cheek. ""Hullo there, girl,"" I spoke thickly with sleep and scratched the fox""s head, ""Whaddaya think about all this, hmm?"" She tilted her head left, then licked my cheek again. I laughed and patted her back, ""Yeah, sounds about right."" I extracted myself from the too-plush blankets and bedding. The lighting was still dim, so I slid out of bed and half stumbled to the ornate desk against the wall. It was emblazoned with the Lannister emblem and was that... gold filigree? My eyebrow twitched as I sat down. For the next who knows how long, I tried to write Averill a letter about my arrival. The words were all kinds of messed up and sloppy. Sometimes it took many minutes to remember how to right a certain letter correctly, and I cringed to think of how hard Tyrion and Bronn would laugh if they saw it. But I folded it as neatly as I knew how regardless.",748687
949,"Ulrich stroked the base of his submissive""s skull, and William released a low, purring noise from his throat. The final buckle wrapped around to the front, interlocking with a D-ring; all that was missing was the padlock. ""I""ll see you tonight, my sweet William."" Ulrich said, kissing him on the lips. When the padlock clicked into place, William""s consciousness faded. William closed his eyes and let the darkness-and the safety of Ulrich""s presence, overtake him. His body was now under Ulrich""s control. Now, Ulrich has trained and held many submissives over the years, but William was the only one who could suppress his mental functions so completely so as to (what seemed to Ulrich) disable his short-term memory but leave all William""s other functions intact. Ulrich lived on control and while he disapproved of X.A.N.A. forcibly taking control of William""s body, he had to admit, somewhere inside of him Ulrich had been jealous. Because whatever feelings Ulrich held towards William personally, he had sensed William""s submissive side soon after they met. Call it a third sense, but Ulrich lived for control over submissives. Normally he wouldn""t have been able to tell, but lifestyle submissives, those he could spot a mile away. Because they were different from the rest. They lived for people like Ulrich, for Dominants to control their every move, to live and breathe the D/s lifestyle. So damn it all that X.A.N.A. had gotten to William first. Once William was freed from X.A.N.A. ""s control, Ulrich had been done waiting. X.A.N.A. had gotten to William before Ulrich had been able to begin operation ""Control William"". Yeah, it was a stupid title, but it""s not like anyone was going to find out. But now William was free and Ulrich would make damn sure it didn""t stay that way because Ulrich had plans, and his currently goal was making (and keeping) William as his submissive. By any means necessary. Ulrich was a bastard. He called Yumi to ""their spot"" in the forest, because Aelita""s appearance in the real world sparked a fire inside him. Ulrich saw how happy Aelita and Jeremie were to finally be able to touch each other, to know they are now standing in the same room instead of through a virtual screen. Those emotions, the relief and happiness those two felt, had been contagious. Yet, it also reminded Ulrich that he had been stringing along his relationship with Yumi. He liked her, and before William, he had been sure that ""like"" was close enough to ""love"" that Ulrich had confused the two. See, submissives for Ulrich had always been that, not involved in his daily life outside of what use they could provide him. Finding a submissive to become a willingly helpless slave... it was a rare trait, and so far, not one had even come close to the wonders he found within William. Ulrich kept William at a distance during their ""training"" period. Yet had underestimated just how submissive William was. Somewhere along the way, the lines between submissive and William began to converge. Ulrich shook his head, shrugging off the past. Now was no time to reminisce.",583994
1293,"Hate it?"" ""N-no, it""s just that-"" ""Would you like ""angel fluff"" instead?"" Princess Bubblegum""s mind stopped for a while. For the first time, the genius ruler""s mind stopped thinking for a while. For a very long time, she realized that""s she""s blushing. ""D-don""t you know... that... I am a real princess?"" The vampire was a bit shocked himself. ""What? Seriously?! REALLY?"" ""Uh... yeah. Basically."" ""Shit."" He floated back and forth, kind of panicking. The princess was a bit confused at the young vampire""s sudden actions. ""W-what""s wrong?"" ""You must be what they call a ""Parallel Person""..."" ""A parallel what now?"" They young vampire floated his way in front of the young ruler and tried to say something. Princess Bubblegum felt the chill on her spine. ""You must be Gumball""s alternate."" ""What?"" asked the baffled princess. ""Hey, PG. What""s this?"" Fionna, the young adventuress, asked as she peered on an old, musky mirror. The young prince turned to her, and then smiled gently. ""That""s an ancient mirror my ancestors left. Nobody was seen to use that, thus I don""t know what it does exactly."" He explained at the curious young girl. Her loyal cat, Cake, came to her side and poked the glass of the mirror. ""Whatever it is, it sure is old and weird."" ""That""s why it""s ancient, Cake."" Fionna said and brofisted her bud. As Fionna peered even more and tried to poke the mirror, Prince Gumball covered the said mirror with a white cloth. ""Alright ladies. That""s enough poking and peering. You never know what this mirror can do."" Fionna and Cake whined that made the young prince chuckle. ""Okay okay, enough with those faces. I""ll bake you some chocolate chip cookies. Come on now, let""s go down."" The two buds high-five""d each other then went along with Prince Gumball. Little did they know, a certain Vampire King had already discovered the mirrors abilities. A/N: Oh yah. Totally my first time writing an Adventure Time Fanfic and I am having fun. I actually had this idea months ago but then again, my lazy hands doesn""t want to. Reviews are my blood and air. Oh well! C""est la vie! So yeah guys. This is chapter one. The next update is probably going to happen next year. Haha. Yeah. So uh... I am... signing out... peace. This chapter came in a little early as a New Year gift to you guys! Have a Happy New Year guys! :)))))) ""Princeeeeeeeeeees! I am hungry. Why do we have to stay in your room anyway?"" The Vampire King complained while floating, making the young princess to sigh heavily. Princess Bubblegum was busily hiding some personal things she had in her drawers and closet. One of those things was the tee shirt Marceline gave her. ""You need to make a low profile, uh..."" she paused, hoping the get his name as she closed the drawer on her dresser. ""Marshall Lee."" The young vampire answered. ""You need to make a low profile, Marshall Lee."" Princess Bubblegum said as she was done hiding her stuff. Meanwhile, the young vampire named Marshall Lee rolled his eyes and crossed his arms in disappointment. ""I""m bored, princess."" ""Bubblegum, Princess Bonnibel Bubblegum.",2750536

Send comments, suggestions or criticism to Soulfire Stories@aol.com [McQueen/McPherson household] ""Sam..."" Brooke finally managed to get Sam""s name out of her name; They had been home for a few hours now and Harrison had just left. Brooke had watched in silence as Harrison comforted Sam, she saw the angry/saddened/confused look on his face and she fought back the urge to comfort Sam too but Sam had made it clear that the only person she wanted to be touched by was Harrison. *start of flashback* Don""t let me go"" Harrison looked down at Sam. ""Okay I won""t"" Sam buried her face into Harrison""s chest and started to cry again. *end of flashback* They all had stood there for a while in the middle of the room and watched as Harrison held a crying Sam in his arms, they didn""t say a word... not even George, they just watched in silence. Maybe they were afraid that if someone said something that things would get even worse, so they just kept their mouths shut and watched, not knowing what else to do. Brooke had been through a lot of things in her life: popularity, unpopularity, eating disorder but seeing her best friend and sister to be crying after almost being raped by some college creep was all new to her and it was the most terrifying thing she could have seen and all she knew was that the horrified look Sam had on her face would be branded into her memory forever. After a few minutes Harrison suggested that they take Sam home; Harrison held Sam in his arms on what seemed to Brooke McQueen the longest car ride home. Sam""s cries were heard throughout the whole car even though they weren""t loud, the cries echoed in everybody""s ears and all they could do was try to remember that time would heal this experiment gone terribly wrong. George had let Harrison hold Sam, it was what she wanted and if Harrison was the key to make Sam to be able to smile again then George would back away until she called for him to come back... she would call him back, at least he hoped she would. Lily and Carmen had insisted on coming with Harrison and Brooke to be with Sam too but Harrison told them to go home and get some rest, that all Sam needed right now was some sleep and that they could see her in the morning. Harrison had stayed with Sam for a few hours and then Sam insisted he go home so his mother wouldn""t worry, Harrison had tried to protest but Sam told him she still had Brooke and she was okay and then he had left too.",29783
1569,"""Byakko..."" The cleric called from the registry scroll. Byakko stepped forward as he held the piece of paper on hand, shaking faintly. Throwing the amulet on the ground, he waited in abated breath as a peculiar corpse rose. It was a zombie. Byakko knew that, but somehow it wasn""t in the tint of violet. It was more of the blue. Looking back at the cleric for confirmation to attack it, Byakko charged at the zombie with his 6 Chain, finishing the fiend in four strikes. No loot came out. The cleric gasped for air when he realized that the zombie was no more than smoke, disappearing in the air as the ground shook and a fissure formed in the center. Strange pentagram like symbols appeared on the crack as a very large demon-undead rose from it. It looked like a rotting sorcerer with a large aura and floating in the air. Dark Illusion. Byakko had studied almost all the known monsters of Rune-Midgard; and he was most fascinated in the area of Necrology and Demon Physiology. He had known and identified any undead and demon, whether existing in his time or not. Dark Illusion was no laughing matter. They were known servants of the Dark Lord, the undead MVP monster. And their spells are in almost comparison to their master. Byakko realized it was just too late when the creature shrouded him with his ghostly cloak, shutting him from the view of others. It felt like he was falling and falling into an unknown dimension. He landed with a thud on something like a transparent floor. There was no light around them, yet they saw each other; Dark Illusion and himself. The monster began his assault at the scared acolyte, realizing that he was no match for the demon. He snapped his head to his side and braced himself for the impending doom, as the undead neared its rotting hand at the crouched boy. A small luster passed between them. And the monster paused its assault at the young boy. Electricity seemed to pass through them as Byakko felt something different, not quite the slashes of a claw or the breaking of his bones as he was going to be torn apart A gentle stroke... The rotting hand slowly caressed the tiger markings on Byakko""s face, its ebony luster responding to the evil energy that the creature emanated. Byakko gaped at him and was paralyzed with fear and wonder. The creature""s mouth opened to deliver a raspy sound, Byakko observed that he might not have spoken for a long time and was unable to do it properly now. A few attempts later and audible words started forming in the series of gasps and hoarse sentences. ""You..."" Words finally came out. ""Why do you wear these markings that demons and evil know alone? ""I...I am no human. Demi-human perhaps, but I know I am not human..."" Byakko stuttered at the powerful being. ""It is true...then. Son of Sohee Mistress, you are...aren""t you?"" Dark Illusion pierced the blue eyes of Byakko.",583064
3054,"Jacques had felt the bitter sting of defeat before, more often than he""d like to admit, but this felt even worse. He wanted to rescue the children of his dear, dead friends. It had nothing to do with the pretty woman Jacqueline had sent his way and his desire to look good in front of her. The inelegant turns of phrase Jacques had experienced in front of Olivia made him think about the fact that he knew Jacqueline shared Kit""s concerns about him getting too lost in his work since Lemony""s second disappearance. The last time he""d spoken with Kit she had told him, ""You""re in too deep, Jacques. You spend too much time in that taxi and no time out in the world."" ""That""s not true."" ""Really? When""s the last time you didn""t sleep in the taxi and instead used a hotel or other means of sleep that involved a bed rather than your backseat?"" Jacques had shifted uncomfortably unsure of the answer, having spent at least the last month sleeping in his cab. Kit didn""t wait for his answer. ""I just worry about you. You""re like a brother to me."" ""I am your brother, Kit. You""re twin brother, in fact."" ""Yes, and I""m not letting my child,"" she had patted her still flat stomach meaningfully, ""hang out with their weird uncle."" Jacques had wanted to ask if she was planning on letting her child spend time with its weird, workaholic father, but knew better than to criticize her romantic decisions. The last time he""d expressed such a concern had ended about as poorly as it possibly could. Despite his current mission, he still hoped he could avoid Olaf, not wanting to see the man who""d once been a friend but had since then caused his family to implode for a period of time. Kit had almost completely recovered, Olaf""s promise of a last kiss still haunting her, but Lemony never really had. He still desperately loved Beatrice, despite making peace with her marriage and children as well as her death. Lemony would never get over what his once best friend had done to the woman he loved. Many in VFD believed Lemony dead, but Jacques didn""t. Neither did Kit. They knew their brother. He was no great fighter, but he was the best ran and hider in the world. Lemony had spent most of his life on the lam, probably more of it than anyone else. He could survive anything. He would survive them all. Olivia was now driving, as she had committed to the VFD after he had told her the entire story, even taking her to the Baudelaire fire. Jacques knew he should probably sit in the back seat to keep up the illusion of a cab, but he also knew she was still in training, so he rode beside her. From this new position, he could smell her better, the scent of old books and ink from stamping library books. It was a good scent, one he quite liked. Jacques kept his eyes on the road, trying to ignore the pretty woman at his side and focus on the mission. She had called him sturdy, he remembered. It didn""t seem like much of compliment, but it had felt like the best one he""d ever received. He noticed her eyes kept drifting shut, so he guided her to park the car behind a billboard.",1497577
2225,"I""m just puffed with anticipation!"" He and Calamity continued their duel of the desserts as his lady stared from the bowl, to the whisk and then at his staff. ""Chat!"" ""Yes, M""Lady?"" he grunted as he deflected a flurry of petite fours. ""Make her mad! I have my plan."" Ladybug grinned. ""You""ve got it, Bugaboo."" AK: What could her plan be? R&R, please. Chat was really good at being annoying. And this time, Ladybug meant it as a compliment. She dodged and weaved under fire of desserts and sweets. Every so often, Calamity would spew creme glace, and Ladybug would be there to catch it in her bowl. The dance continued for what seemed like hours, but was probably around ten minutes. Finally, Calamity erupted in anger. ""ENOUGH!"" she exploded, striking the ground with her whisk. Suddenly, a wall of spongy, warm red velvet cake encased their legs. She caught them in a cake-trap. ""Well, this is definitely not the cakewalk I thought it would be."" Chat joked lamely as Calamity began whipping up what looked like- ""Are you seriously about to smother us in royal icing?"" Ladybug demanded, acutely offended. Calamity paused. ""Does the victim not agree with the crowning her demise?"" ""Uh, no!"" Ladybug rolled her eyes. ""You obviously need to visit a real bakery. Everyone knows you eat red velvet with cream cheese or white chocolate frosting."" ""Um, M""Lady?"" Chat sang from his own prison. ""Are you sure this is the proper time to debate icing for a cake?"" ""Of course this is the right time!"" snapped both Calamity and Ladybug. ""Cream cheese frosting?"" Calamity muttered. ""My aunt always frosted our cake with royal icing... It was her signature."" Her free hand absently moved to the necklace around her neck. ""I see. What was she like?"" Ladybug prompted. Calamity smiled, a glimmer of Colette in there. ""She was strong, proud. She baked a mean tiramisu, and red velvet cake. She taught me to do my best and let the work speak for itself."" Ladybug felt a pang. ""And would she want you terrorizing your workplace over something as petty as this?"" ""What do you know?"" Calamity snapped, before Colette sighed an answer, ""No..."" ""Then, please, let us help you, Colette. Give us the necklace and we can end this. Make your aunt proud."" Ladybug urged. Calamity seemed to consider it, and Ladybug saw a glimmer of hope, before the outline of Hawk Moth""s akuma mask appeared, ""NO! My name is CHEF CALAMITY!"" she exploded. ""And I will have my culinary triumph completed! Just as soon as I take your Miraculouses..."" ""Chat now would be a good time to stick your paws in the cake!"" Ladybug cried. ""You""ve got it, my baking Buginette."" Chat answered. He whipped out his staff and started cutting through the cake around them. ""You know, I hate to cut this cake without you, M""Lady."" ""Trust me, this is no hardship on my heart, mon minou."" Ladybug wryly remarked. Freed from the spongy prison, Chat and Ladybug began attacking Calamity""s fury of cooking and baking. ""Chat, hold this and follow my lead!"" She shoved the bowl into his hands and charged through the flurry of cakes and pastries.",3439302
3301,"And having Whip call me a weakling doesn""t exactly help..."" Razor smirked. ""Then, they rushed. They missed out on discovering the full extent of their power as pre-evolutions. Me, I had to wait a couple of months before I evolved into a Grovlye. And then another set of months until I became a Sceptile. And when I did, I couldn""t use any of my moves. I was useless for a while until I realized I needed to be strong to protect those around me and myself; not because I had to prove myself to any moss-brained Servine. You should do the same. Be strong for you."" Ivy nodded pensively. ""Thanks, Razor, you sound like a brother. My real brother left before we could bond. All I know was what I heard on the circuit from Professor Juniper."" Razor pat her head. ""Tell you what, if you really want to get strong, I""ll train you for real tomorrow."" ""Really?"" Ivy peered at him with sharp brown eyes filled with apprehension, earnest and restrained joy. ""Really; chances are Misty will drag Ash on another forced date until she""s satisfied he""s learning enough on his journey."" Ivy half-smiled at that. ""She""s strong-willed."" ""You remind me of her. Now meet me by this tree after breakfast. I usually finish first because of Corphish."" Ivy smirked. ""Will do, coach."" With that, the two Grass-types made a pact and went back to the lab for dinner. Ivy aimed her whirring vines at the wood and lashed out. The vines sliced the upright log like blades cutting through an Oran berry. ""Now, try carving something into it."" Razor ordered from next to her. Ivy focused her vines to carve a Sakura pattern-a favorite of hers since it was on the blanket she""d had as a newly hatched Pokémon. She smiled to herself at the finished carving. ""Nice; a Sakura pattern. Now, let""s work on your Leaf Storm-"" Razor began. ""What""s this, a Pokémon woodshop?"" Whip sneered, coming into view. He waltzed up, with Emi in tow. What""s Emi doing with him? Ivy wanted to know. But she wouldn""t ask; not for the life of her would she ask. Moltres would have to start courting Articuno before she asked. ""Oh, it""s you two. No threat... Now back to your Leaf Storm. Do you think you can store up power for it and then release it?"" Ivy started. Then remembered she was doing this purely for herself. Not for Whip""s approval. ""Yes, I can."" ""Good, try it."" Razor nodded toward some trash littering the ground. It was far apart and plentiful. ""Sweep it all up into one pile with one hit."" Ivy glanced at Whip and Emi, who were snickering at her predicament. Razor gave her a meaningful stare. ""Are you camera-shy? Go!"" Ivy reluctantly began to charge her inner storm. She let it build until it was just a little under wild and let it loose, directing it at the trash. It swept them into a pile and dispersed. ""Nice,"" complimented Razor, ""but not perfect."" ""Yeah, she didn""t sweep them into a trash can."" Emi snickered. Whip smirked. Razor glared and went over to and nearby tree and leaped into the air. He used Leaf Blade and did something and came back with a few Oran berries. He handed her one. He gave her a half smile.",3439302
44,"Hisoka snickered, ""I could never be mad at you."" His smile, however quickly turned into his normal, worried expression. His face couldn""t hide the distraction he felt in his mind. ""Muraki... I know him. He""s up to something and I can feel it."" Tears stained his face as those same, strong gentle hands tried to calm him down again. Tsuzuki had gotten good at remaining calm around Hisoka, and he knew his partner was glad for it. ""I know it hasn""t been that long since you""ve recovered somewhat, but... boss has a mission for us."" Tsuzuki""s voice was full of hesitation and fear, the uncertain realm in not knowing where to tread on a delicate subject. ""Muraki has been up to something, but we don""t know what. He wants us to check out if he might have... left anything behind for us at the mansion. He wanted you to go too, in case there were clues there only you would be able to recognize."" ""When,"" a short, emotionless response. ""When you""re ready. It""s not pressing, but I wanted you to know."" ""Yeah,"" Hisoka pulled himself closer to Tsuzuki""s chest, his hands were lightly shaking from nervousness. Not one to admit his own insecurities that easily, he looked for comfort in the only person he knew he could count on. ""It""s time to go try mixing in with the crowds again,"" Tsuzuki""s voice was soft, ""I know its hard, but I swear I""ll protect you."" A sigh escaped Hisoka""s lips. Tsuzuki was talking about the ""training sessions"" in the realm of the living. They were trying to slowly introduce Hisoka to other people of various sizes, not only to help his mind sort out the insane emotion overload thing, but also to help cure him of the fear he seemed to retain for people in general. Hisoka""s voice seemed frantic, pleading and out of character for him. ""Tsuzuki, I... We don""t have to go up there, right? Can""t we just skip it for today and stay here, together? Please? We have lots of time to-"" Tsuzuki paused Hisoka""s talking with his finger, a worried look matched his feelings. ""Don""t be afraid, Hisoka."" Tilting Hisoka""s head up towards his face, ""I""m right here, okay?"" A gentle kiss locked Hisoka""s attention towards his partner, and also calming his nerves down immensely. The only person he didn""t seem to be afraid of, was his quirky partner. The park during the middle of the afternoon on a weekday was usually pretty sparce. Those who weren""t working either had the day off, or probably never had a job to begin with. Slightly cloudly and with the sun peaking through, the day all in all, wasn""t too bad. Hisoka felt like a clingy child at the moment, holding ontoTsuzuki""s arm like the sky was falling. Tsuzuki, however, just responded with gentle touches for silent encourgment. He wasn""t sure if he would ever get used to the new feelings he felt from strangers, but there was always hope. ""I wonder why Muraki did this? Why... Why did he-"" Hisoka was stoped by a gentle shushing motion. ""Focus on the task at hand, okay? What do you feel now?"" Tsuzuki scanned the area, two people in the distance, and another dog walker on the other side of the path.",583994

They were moving up the stairs now. ""Come on, girl, this way,"" he added to Elle before entering a room. It was a girl""s room, no doubt about that: a pretty floral design covered the walls, and a large dresser stood against one wall with a lovely round mirror. Bottles of nail polish and face powder littered the top. A small bookshelf sat in the corner. ""Come on, now, let""s get him into bed."" They dumped Marty onto the bed, which was neatly made. Elle sank into the window seat, shaking. Marty was just hit by a car. They were in a stranger""s house. They had just met their teenaged fathers. In 1955. ""There we go, he should be fine."" ""Thank you,"" she said. ""Don""t mention it,"" he said gruffly. He was about to leave but he turned around again. ""By the way, what""s your name?"" Elle opened her mouth to say it was Elle, but she quickly remembered that she was in a different time period, that she did not belong. ""Um... Anne."" ""Anne?"" Sam asked, fishing for a last name. ""Just Anne."" ""Is this here fella your brother or what?"" ""Er... brother. He""s my brother."" Sam held up his hands. ""Alright. Don""t hesitate to ask me or Stella for anything, okay?"" ""Okay. Thanks again."" He shut the door. Elle sat there, the only sound breaking the silence being Marty""s soft breathing. She looked at him and felt a rush of warmth. He looked so innocent, so helpless, like a... like a... Like a lost puppy. ""Oh, Jesus Christ,"" Elle murmured, burying her head in her hands. What was happening? This was her best friend, this was the guy she""d known since, what, second grade? She wasn""t supposed to like him. She was supposed to just be his best friend, be the person who was there when he was down, when he was stressed out, when he just needed a laugh. That was who she was supposed to be. Sure, Marty was cute, and sure, he was cool and all, but he was like her brother. After all, who would date their own brother? And even if she did like him, it wasn""t like she could date him. He was dating Jennifer, and he wouldn""t break up with her over something as trivial as Elle... She put her hand in her pocket and fingered the page from the phone book. Doc!

Well, whatever, she thought. Henry and Stella seemed like nice people. They could take care of him for a while. Right now, she had business to attend to. And she was going to get that business done. Or not, she thought as she tried on another dress in the boutique. She had to pass through downtown again to get to Doc""s old address after a kind businessman gave her directions. As she walked past the shops and diners the boy""s scathing remark went through her head again. ""Hey, chick, are you wearing your father""s pants or what?"" Funny, because her father was there when he said that...",2855986
785,"""Spence, the hospital records had Nephilim""s DNA from all her tests on file,"" She said quietly, ""Even a karyotype had been done. I... cross-referenced them to the other data and found something."" She fell silent. A second went by - why didn""t she just say it? - before I opened my mouth, ""Come on, Garcia; what is it?"" ""..."" She seemed to be shuffling around papers in front of her, breaking eye contact with all of us, ""I got some matches."" My eyes widened as far as they could, all traces of exhaustion wiped from my features. She had found something on her? Had her body finally been found? Maybe I could finally put it all behind me, finally get some closure and... wait... ""some matches?"" ""... Nephilim is the biological mother of all seventeen known victims,"" Garcia said slowly. She then started to gush out, ""Oh Spencer, I was scared to tell you, but wanted you to hear from me. From what you told us, it seemed you were really close to her. I am so sorry, Spence... Spencer?!"" I was already out of the room. What was this I was feeling? So many emotions, all bombarding my senses all at once. Anger; anger at that doctor. If he was the father of one of the dead newborns, and Nephilim the mother... she would never consent to it. I don""t know how I knew, I just did. That... that monster. Was he ""the oracle""?! Had he killed the Christenson""s?! Then relief. A relief so strong that I felt like I would collapse. She, as of nine months ago, was alive. Alive and breathing. According to the letter, another child was on the way. That meant... that she could still be alive, even now! Somewhere, some place, Nephilim was alive. Alive and - if the unsub was to keep their pattern - with child. But alive nonetheless. An overwhelming sense of helplessness. Thirteen years had passed since the death of Leah and Micheal Christenson. This whole time, even in the absence of a body, everyone had believed her dead. Her body was weak; there was no way she could survive without medication. Maybe had I not given up on the search... maybe if I had done something, none of this would have happened. None of those children would have died. Then there was one I could not place. Somewhere in the middle of a triangle of sadness, shock, and disgust. Seventeen children... that meant that their mother, Nephilim, had to have been pregnant one after another for nearly thirteen years. From the time she was ten. Was she raped? ""Of course... she wouldn""t have...' My thoughts trailed off. Thirteen years... would she even look the same? Marred beyond recognition, body battered and broken from the weight of constant pregnancy? According to the letter, another child was on the way... that""s meant that, somewhere, she was alive. Alive and carrying a possible twentieth child. The largest and most frightening emotion that took an unshakable hold in my heart was rage. An undiluted, pure desire for destruction. To destroy anything, anyone, just to vent out the horrid twist of emotions surging unblocked through my veins. I was seeing red; my breath was hitched and labored.",748687
134,"Prepare yourself, Yuuki-san!] ""What will you do, Switch-kun? You are powerless against the very things you fail to acknowledge!"" Yuuki taunted, but Switch remained unfazed as always. [Sacrifices must be made for the sake of science. In this case, I will sacrifice myself and absorb the occult knowledge necessary for me to rid my computer of this troublesome curse. I will accompany you tomorrow in order to compile all the information on the occult I will ever need. The probability of your failure is in my favor. Once again, I will prove the uselessness of such ridiculous beliefs!] Switch exclaimed loudly through his voice synthesizer. Yuuki simply laughed under her breath again, knowing fully well that she wouldn""t submit to Switch""s words anytime soon. ""So sudden, Switch-kun! You think you can handle a drink from the dark waters? I will show you things you will not be able to unsee! The spirits will rend your very soul, and you will see into depths of knowledge that no person was ever meant to know! Such knowledge can make one go mad..."" [You underestimate me. I am not some Lovecraftian hero. Soon you""ll be wondering why you ever decided to delve in the occult in the first place. Soon you""ll acknowledge just how fake that film really is!] ""Lies! You speak lies, Switch-kun!"" [Do I? Or are you just unable to accept the facts?] ""Your views are from a perspective that refuses to take the human element into account. All the numbers and facts in the world cannot disprove the realm of darkness that all of us pretend does not exist! But it is there, Switch-kun! I have seen it with my own eyes!"" [Your words mean nothing to me. They are simply the ramblings of a mad girl...] And so, Switch and Yuuki continued their debate far past lunch period, and the two of them both ended up regretting drawing out their argument for so long. Switch""s resolve remained strong as always though, and he was already planning every detail of his time with Yuuki. Yuuki, on the other hand, had other ideas. She just couldn""t wait to toy with his mind, which so rooted in science and fact, would soon be forced into her world of superstition and the supernatural. Such is the fate of those who are unable to compromise. And that""s all we got so far, folks! Next part should be coming up soon! And here comes the second part out of three, willing readers! Writing this part was quite the challenge, so I hope it came out halfway decent. Anyway, enjoy, and if you like it, be sure to leave a review! For once, Yuuki felt frightened at the prospect of being drawn by something that she could not explain. Such was the case tonight, when she found herself outside of Switch""s house for no real reason. Of course, she had been restless, and although this was a common occurrence for her, it still seemed very strange for her to be here. And now, after having walked down the length of her street and beyond, she was here, in front of her sworn rival""s home. Yuuki reached into her pocket and pulled out her phone. The digital numbers translated to her as 11:58 PM. Two minutes till midnight.",967934

So Numbuh 27 pulls out a puppet of Father as he speaks while imitating the voice, ""Duh, my name is Father and I purposely set myself on fire because I""m a big stupid head, also I""m a single father who raised five children I kidnapped and brainwashed... and I don""t find it weird at all, DERP!"" ((WE INTERRUPT THIS PROGRAM FOR THIS BREAKING KNDTV REPORT!))

Mr. Boss, Mr. Wink, Mr. Fibb, Mr. Fizz, and Knightbrace then use their technology to watch the report and Mr. Boss then says, ""At least they don""t know we had to do with their disappearance."" Numbuh 411 then states, ""This just in! Other operatives have started capturing other villains and questioning them about Sector""s V""s whereabouts."" The five then start getting nervous and then Knightbrace asks, ""Say, where""s the Toilenator?"" Then the other four then mutter, ""Uh...Oh!"" Numbuh 411 continues, ""We got news that the Toilenator has been captured and is given the worst yet ironic torture delivered by our top scientist Numbuh 74.239 himself..."" Then the screen shows Numbuh 74.239 giving a ""swirly"" to the Toilenator until he talks. ((Swirly- The process of sticking someone""s head in the toilet and flushing, a schoolyard bully""s favorite method of bullying)) He keeps flushing until the Toilenator shouts, ""OK OK! I""LL SING LIKE A CANARY! tweet! tweet! tweet! tweet!"" Numbuh 74. 239 then says, ""No not that kind of singing, just tell us what you know about what happened to Sector V, or else we continue giving you a Swirly!"" Toilenator then replies, ""Oh that""s what you wanted to know, well ok... Mr. Boss, Mr. Wink, Mr. Fibb, Mr. Fizz, and Knightbrace has too much wild root beer one night and they crashed the C.O.O.L.B.U.S. containing them in it and you can guess the rest, I didn""t do it but I saw the crash... say if I told you where the crash was will you give me a reduced sentence?"" Numbuh 74.239 then replies, ""Wow... just wow... I better get Numbuh 101 and a search party ready."" The villians are shocked and Mr. Fizz then says, ""I knew that potty mouth would slip! Now what do we do?"" The villains panic. Meanwhile the search party do indeed find the wrecked C.O.O.L.B.U.S. and the five items they left behind. Then the leader of the search party Numbuh 480 then goes up to Numbuh 481 and says to him, ""Yep, that was indeed Sector V in that bus, the bodies are presumed to be charred into piles of dust.""",910821
3217,"""Jamila we are ready to go,"" one of her soldiers said informing her. ""Good give this map to Jabari. He shall find the way easily. It""s already marked on the map,"" Jamila said pulling the map out and handing it to the soldier to give to Jabari. The soldier quickly walked off leaving Jamila all alone again. She looked up again at the air balloon and saw that it was nearing them only at a faster pace. ""What are they doing? Have they lost their mind,"" Jamila asked. ""No, but we are about to find out,"" Imhotep said pulling his horse up next to hers. ""I may need help with this one father,"" Jamila said jumping off her horse and walking toward the balloon that was approaching fast. ""We need them to think we don""t want them to follow us still, but they need to learn that they can""t attack us either,"" Imhotep said as he jumped off. Jamila nodded and suddenly looked up at the sky and what clouds where there began to grow and become a dark black. Imhotep looked up as well and raised a hand to a sky right as lightning struck down at him. He took in the power of the lightning and then redirected it toward the balloon. Surprisingly it missed, and this time Jamila took matters into her own hands, literally. She raised her hands and as she did the rain that made the sand wet suddenly formed huge clay hands that reached out to grasp the balloon from the sky. The balloon managed to dodge the hands as well as landing the balloon on the ground. Ardeth, Rick, Eve, and Alex all came out with guns shooting. Jamila took her pistols off of her belt and began to shoot as well. The soldiers behind them ran to help Imhotep and Jamila as they fought off the four. Anck-su-namun took Eve on as they were going at it. Imhotep managed to knock Rick""s gun out of his hand and now they were fist fighting. Ardeth was busy fighting with all the guards leaving Alex to fight Jamila. ""Long time no see,"" Alex smirked as he swung a punch at Jamila, which she did a back flip to avoid. ""How about no see at all,"" Jamila said as spun and kicked him in the chest sending him to the sand. ""I""m not leaving without my sister,"" Alex said as he jumped up angered now. ""Funny neither am I,"" Jamila laughed as she swung a punch at Alex, which he dodged and in return landed one in her gut making her fall to the sand. He went to kick her while she was down, but she grabbed his shoe in time to make him trip. From there they began to wrestle around on the sand. At some points they managed to pin each other, but the other would always surprise the other who had them pinned. Jamila was now under Alex as he held her hands above her head and had his knee on her stomach keeping her down. Jamila felt embarrassed as she noticed some of soldiers glance at her. ""Give up,"" Alex said with a smirk at her. ""Never,"" Jamila hissed as she used her abilities and made the sand lurch up at him and knock him off of her. She then used the wet sand again to send a huge wave at him and knock him down. Alex managed to get back up and run at her again. Jamila ran at him as well and managed to take him back down to the ground.",806976
2639,"Turning around, he looked at the four glass bottles on top of the golden throne, each one containing one of the dreaded chaos gods. Slaanesh, Tzeetch, Khorne and Nurgle. ""Horus,"" said the Emperor, tapping a finger playfully on the glass bottles holding the most terrible beings in the universe, ""If you had been afraid of me I would not have been forced to siphon off some chaos energy and turn your traitorous brothers into chaos fuelled monsters. It""s your fault Horus that I let chaos into the world. If you were afraid then you would have just followed the Imperial creed of atheism, science and obedience and all of this could have been avoided."" At this point, Horus burst out in anger at his so called father. ""DON""T TRY TO TURN THIS AROUND ON ME!"" The Warmaster pointed an accusing finger at the master of mankind, ""You committed genocide against any human group that would not obey you in totality, you allowed poverty, disease and ignorance to thrive on countless feral and feudal worlds, under your reign the hive worlds have rotted into crime and degeneracy while squeezing them of their resources to feed a few core worlds! Whole planets are strip mined and the peoples enslaved for you! You are worse than the xenos overlords you claim to ""liberate"" people from and worst of all you tried to infect me with a Nurglite blade?!"" ""Your infection by chaos was necessary, Horus,"" the emperor explained kindly, ""With my secret project on Terra complete, chaos was now under my control; you were a guinea pig to see how precisely I could use chaos as a weapon and you should have been honoured to sacrifice your soul in my name."" ""Why would you do that?"" Horus screamed, tears rolling down his face, ""Why would you try to control the most evil force in creation? What possible purpose could that serve? Why would you keep all of us, your sons in the dark about something that could literally consume our very souls and grew stronger in ignorance?"" The Emperor was starting to get annoyed, his eyes remained unchanged but his tone was getting terse and his tone was getting clipped. ""Horus, you know that under the imperial truth there can be no gods; there is only the rule of my law. Under my law your life had no value and I""m very sorry it had to be that way. I""m truly sorry that I infected you with Chaos, Horus; but I was always planning to cure you of it when the time was right; always. By throwing out the demon possession you irrevocably ruined my plans and you needed to be killed for that."" ""YOU MANIAC!"" Horus accused his father, ""WHAT WAS THE POINT OF ANY OF IT? MORE HAVE DIED IN YOUR GREAT CRUSADE THAN IN THIS CIVIL WAR! IT""S PUBLIC RECORD! ANYONE CAN SEE THE BODY COUNTS IN THE PUBLIC LEXICANUM!"" ""Horus, public records can be changed easily. In less time than you can blink the records will say what I order them to."" The Warmaster hissed through his teeth, ""that""s if I let you cover this up."" The emperor""s lip curled slightly, just by a micron. ""Horus, I don""t like the way you""re speaking to me. I didn""t intentionally try to infect you with chaos.",1220273
1583,"Verne looked at Mookie a little furious and said, ""Be that as it may, you feel as if you have nothing, but to me, they""re gonna like you than me. I""m not gonna let it happen."" He walked away, leaving Mookie feeling a little distraught. He might make himself feel better by singing a little song. He brought out his guitar and strummed it and sang to himself feeling a little lonely and misunderstood. He thought of his mother and makes it better with a song he wrote a few years ago. Seems like it was yesterday when I saw your face You told me how proud you were But I walked away If only I knew what I know today Ooh-ooh I would hold you in my arms I would take the pain away Thank you for all you""ve done Forgive all your mistakes There""s nothing I would do To hear your voice again Sometimes I wanna call you But I know you won""t be there Ohh, I""m sorry for blaiming you For everything I just couldn""t do And I""ve hurt myself by hurting you Somedays I feel broke inside But I won""t admit Sometimes I just wanna hide Cause it""s you I miss And it""s so hard to say goodbye When it comes to this Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah Would you tell me I was wrong?Would you help me understand Are you looking down upon me?

I""m sorry for blaming you For everything I just couldn""t do And I""ve hurt myself... Mookie strummed the guitar and finished the song with a tear in his eye and his voice broke. By hurting you Then, he started to cry and walked back to the log while everyone was sleeping. He laid down and fell asleep with one tear shed down from his face, thinking about his mom. That song was ""Hurt"" from Christina Aguilera. I felt it was a very sweet and gentle song for Mookie. Read and review, please! Chapter 5: Comforting Mookie The next morning, Mookie went through his pictures of him and his mom, spending time when he was a kid. He laughed to himself and sniffled a little. He wiped his eyes and said, ""Man, I miss her so badly."" Heather walked past him and said, ""Hi. Can I sit with you?"" Mookie stared at her and nodded his head. She sat next to Mookie in a rock and said, ""What are you doing?"" ""Looking through my pictures so just me and my mom having fun. I""ve had such an awesome childhood. Now that she""s gone, I just feel like I""ve got no one around me."" said Mookie. ""Well, you have us."" said Heather. ""Not according to Verne. He told me last night that I would be better off somewhere else and that you like me better than him. I don""t take anyone""s place as leader. I didn""t mean to leave him out in the cold."" said Mookie. ""That""s just the way Verne is. He""s afraid that everything will change when there""s new people here. Just give him some time and he""ll get used to you."" said Heather.",1276465
570,"My offer to sponsor you is still open,"" his father said. He was smiling in a none-too-pleasant fashion, indicating an ulterior motive. ""Still thinking about it, Kuwabara-jiisan,"" Hikaru answered. ""I""m still not sure I want to become a pro."" ""You""re acting like you""d pass it without question,"" Kuwabara retorted, before letting out a cackling laugh. ""I beat Akira fairly regularly, don""t I?"" Akira would have snorted, if his mother hadn""t been there. ""One in every five matches, maybe,"" he corrected. ""I wouldn""t call that regularly."" ""That""s better than any of the young pros, though? When""s the last time you lost to a lower-dan?"" Akira lowered his eyes, not willing to seem boastful. ""My boy""s never lost to anyone under a five-dan rating since entering the pro league!"" His father answered for him instead, punctuating the statement with another laugh. ""So what? Mother still beats me on a daily basis, and she""s not a professional."" His father cast a sly look at Kouko. ""She""s a very special lady. One in a billion - but that""s no excuse for not seeking to advance in the professional world. Most of the best players in the world compete professionally."" ""But not all,"" Akira returned. ""What about SAI?"" As soon as he spoke, Akira knew he""d said the wrong thing. He was sitting in a room with two of the very few people who might have a better idea of who SAI was than anyone else, but his mother had never done anything to acknowledge her tie with SAI, and Hikaru had never acknowledge he even recognized the name. The silence weighed heavily in the room, and Akira wished there was a way to take back his words. His father didn""t seem inclined to help, instead looking at Kouko with narrowed eyes. But she merely lifted her chopsticks, daintily eating a mouthful of rice. ""You know about SAI?"" Hikaru said after a long moment. ""I didn""t know you were into NetGo."" ""I didn""t know you were,"" Akira replied pertly. ""And most of the younger pros follow NetGo avidly, especially since SAI started playing regularly."" None of the Kuwabara family could miss the way Hikaru shifted in his seat, squirming with discomfort. ""Oh,"" he said, ""I thought NetGo was too casual for you. I mean, the games don""t count for anything..."" ""All games count,"" Kouko said softly, her eyes catching Hikaru""s through their sheer intensity. ""Every Go player""s game is changed by those they challenge, and they take another step on the road to the Hand of God."" It was really weird to watch his mother stare at his best friend like that, Akira thought, feeling a bit uncomfortable himself. He was the one who knew the truth, about how the two regularly fought over the goban. While he wasn""t convinced Hikaru was SAI, he did believe his friend had, at least, studied under that master""s hand. ""Playing Go online is a good thing, but it doesn""t match the real experience,"" Hikaru said. ""I mean, I like to watch the games SAI plays with KOUYO, but I get the feeling the games would be much better if they sat across the goban from each other, in person.",1112924

The blond guy in question was completely decked out in what looked like the coolest gear for bladers.

They heard a woman screech from outside the door. Julie shot Lexi a wry look. ""Told you so."" Night fell in Gotham and Ender was on the prowl. He stalked the streets in a dated hat and battered coat. Downtown Gotham, sometimes called Old Gotham, wreaked of crime. His palms itched to do something about it, but he had his orders. He had a goal. He followed the younger Colter as he skulked through Old Gotham in a posse of rich kid goons. The whole lot of them were from affluent families, all prep kids from Gotham Prep, and all thought they were badass-invincible. Ender easily kept pace with them in the shadows, using the crowd and then streetlights as coverage. They entered a rundown neighborhood, the six plus Colter a mini-mob that caught eyes but quickly made them look away. They came to a dilapidated apartment complex. Ender watched as the lead teen- a rich punk Homebase identified as Devon Brace- pointed to the brickwall of the group- a tubby little porker named Edwin Phillips. He said something and then took the steps to the building. The rest of guys followed and then Edwin took a menacing stance in front of the door. Ender slipped further back into the shadows before making the four touch dismount to the roof. He found a niche right before the roof and waited. Homebase theorized that their target lived in 23E, and she was rarely wrong with her intel. Sure enough, Brace kicked in the flimsy door of the apartment, startling the hunched figure on the couch. A pale and skinny woman with greasy, dirty hair, the color hidden by the grime, stumbled to her bare feet, eyes wide. ""Where""s our money, Irma?"" sneered Yosif Berken, the crew""s resident mouthpiece. ""Irma"" shook her head. ""Y-you""re said- you said I-I had another w- week. Y-you promised."" She looked accusingly at the teen, but held herself protectively. ""Things change."" Berken leered at her barely clad body. Irma backed away, towards her purse. Ruffling through, she threw a fistful of cash at them. ""H-here! Take it! It""s all I have."" Ender calculated seven hundred creds. Maybe half of Berken""s reported allowance. Chump change to any of the families involved. Ender growled low in his throat.",3439302
554,"Though she hugged him, D did not return the gesture. He was as stiff and emotionless as he was around strangers. When he did move, it was not a gesture of love he gave Mina. D got his hands from his father, the fingers were long and spider like. He began to strangle his mother and he was enjoying it. Mina gurgled and her eyes bugged but D""s python grip did not relent. D""s neck muscles stood taught, twelve thousand years worth of anger and hatred stood clear on his face, overpowering his preternatural beauty. The dhampir""s beautiful face was a hideous theater mask made after the likeness of a demon. Vaguely he recalled that he loved his mother, but why? She""d been nearly a horrible a parent as Dracula. Dracula tried to bend D out of shape, make his son as monstrous as himself. But Mina had emotionally neutered D. She""d beaten any ability to have a meaningful emotional relationship out of her son. D wanted to get back at the witch for all the ways that she""d screwed him up. He gritted his fangs as Mina""s face turned blue and her struggled weakened. Oh yes, that""s what he wanted to see. He wanted to strangle the bitch until her eyeballs popped out and rolled around on the stupid linoleum floor of their old home. D grinned as his mother""s eye sockets burst out of their skulls burst out of their skulls but still it wasn""t enough. Then he woke up. D blinked and his mother was gone. In his mother""s place was that stupid girl that had been stalking him. Apparently in his drug induced weariness, he""s begun to strangle her and he just thought it was his mother. Speaking of strangling, he should probably let go of the girl before she suffocated. D""s spiderlike hands let go of Asenath""s throat and he watched her gasp for air. Thankfully, he hadn""t been squeezing as hard as he had during the dream, otherwise the poor girl would be six feet under by now. Leaving Asenath to gather her breath, D stood up and sat down on the rim of the centuries old toilet bowl. Vampires didn""t need toilets but many of their servants did. It was a shame that the air fresheners had broken down, this room really reeked. D spoke to the girl, ""I""m sorry, but I""m told that when I strangle people I""m sexy."" Asenath didn""t have enough breath to say so, but she agreed. She""d been strangled before by kinky lovers but she""d never been so turned on by it until D had tried it. D signed, he wasn""t as young as he used to be. Ever since Luna""s death, he just didn""t have as much energy as he used to and his temper was much shorter. He felt old. Asenath looked at D and trembled. She""d had this thing all planned out, the angle of her approach, what she""s say to D and how she would say it. But now, she was nothing but a babbling idiot before his awesome beauty. Edward Cullen, eat your fucking heart out. Trembling, she noticed that D still had some vomit on the side of his mouth. If he asked her to, she""d gladly lick it off. Instead though, she timidly handed D a tissue from her pocket. D took the tissue without saying thank you and wiped himself off.",1220273
376,"Odd jumped over to help, but the mystery assailant spin-kicked him to the other side of the room. Yumi joined the fray and was also dealt a swift defeat. ""Yumi, Odd, Ulrich!"" Aelita cried. The mystery figure stopped cold. ""Ricky?"" That voice... Ulrich stared at the figure. It was lithe and small, more girlish. The figure ripped off the full mask and a mass of light brown hair flowed out. Sure enough, it was Lyra, dressed in a custom cat suit and kicking their tails like a pro. ""What are you guys doing here?"" she demanded. ""We could ask you the same thing!"" Odd grumbled from the opposite wall. ""I was hunting- Are you guys in league with Code?"" ""Code?"" Ulrich parroted, picking himself up off the floor. ""CODE- all caps. He""s the hacker I wanted help with."" She planted a fist on her hip. ""I was in the middle of shutting him down with my synthesized VENOM program- Viral Execution Net Optimal Muffler. It should stop him from accessing my school and laptop."" ""Computer whiz, much?"" Odd snickered. ""What""s with the Kung fu warrior moves though?"" Jeremy asked. ""I thought you guys were CODE. I was wrong."" She shrugged. ""I just need to finish entering the final strand and- voila- I""ll be out of your hair."" She went back to the chair and started inputting codes at a genius speed. ""Now to send."" Behind her Jeremy surveyed the code. ""How do you know this is the hacker""s point of origin?"" She barely glanced back at him. ""Because he said so."" They all stared at her. ""He said so. That""s a helpful hacker..."" ""I also traced him to this exact place. He thinks this is a game. Some way to slake his boredom. I""m going to end his ""game"" for good."" She pressed enter, and watched with satisfaction as the lines of code were swiftly stripped from the screen, blocking all the points. ""I don""t know how he pulled off the school vandalization though; that""s another story."" Lyra continued. Sparks flew from the gyro-globe. It flashed from Lyoko to blue, until the sparks gathered and centered on one point: Lyra. ""Lyra!"" cried Ulrich, but he was too late. She was zapped and in a flash of light she was gone. ""Lyra?"" Ulrich choked out. ""Whoa. Power trip..."" she said from the opposite wall. ""Lyra!"" Ulrich was by her side in an instant. ""Hey..."" The floor panel beneath her gave way and she fell into a room full of metal cylinders running from the roof to the floor. ""Stay right there, I""ll come and get you."" Ulrich told her. She rolled her eyes, but obeyed. Her ankle was throbbing. She leaned back against the metal wall and sighed. ""Just my luck..."" One of the metal cylinders hissed open, letting a light fog roll out. A dark figure stood inside. ""Yep, just my luck... ULRICH!"" AK: Lyra is a walking magnet for trouble... After all, she""s Ulrich""s kid sister. R&R, please. XS 4 ""So this is the real world..."" the dark figure""s voice was awestruck and sultry. ""Who are you?"" Lyra demanded, still putting up her brave front. The dark figure stepped out of the cylinder and Lyra did a double take. Mega-hotness alert.",3439302

And besides... It""s kind of hard since I""m compared to her half the time."" Ulrich groaned. Yumi kicked the ground hard beneath her boots as she muddled over her cup of hot chocolate. Suddenly, a pair of brown lace-up boots appeared in her view. ""Can I sit with you a while?"" Lyra asked. Yumi looked up at her boyfriend""s sister. ""Sure."" She watched as Lyra sat down and brush invisible dirt off of her lime green skirt. ""Your really close to my brother, right?"" Lyra started. Yumi snorted. ""I thought so..."" Lyra frowned, and then it cleared. ""He never told you I existed, huh?"" Dumbfounded, Yumi nodded. ""It""s always been that way. He thinks that if he doesn""t associate with me, all the bad things in my life will go away."" Yumi whirled to face her. ""But still, I thought we were closer than that. He could have told me. I mean, I thought he""d been acting strange but-I was sure if he had anything on his mind, he""d tell me!"" ""My brother""s weird like that. Ever since that one time when we were kids... He thinks he""s got to be my dad- my protector- whenever we""re together. I feel like a caged bird around him, and my dad."" Lyra stuck out her legs and stared and the toe of her boots. ""Did you know my dad literally banned me from learning self defense? And he took me out of gymnastics when I sprained my ankle once on the monkey bars?"" Yumi blinked. Obviously, she was venting. ""It""s just because he loves you."" ""But he sent me to the Francois Academy for Prodigies! Away from what little friends I had that weren""t afraid to play with me. And if you think his influence stopped there, you should have seen what happened when I got to the Academy. Everyone was afraid of me because of what my dad said the first day. I barely have any friends!"" Yumi felt a pang of sympathy for Lyra. ""You must have had it rough."" ""Ricky-Ulrich""s had it rougher. He thinks it""s his fault I got sent away. Or at least he tortures himself like he does. Well, he used to. He""s changed a lot since then. Thanks."" ""I didn""t do much."" Yumi hastened to correct. Lyra shook her head. ""You did a lot. My brother has a lot of hang ups. I""m glad you""re dating him. And I""m sorry if my sudden appearance puts a strain on your relationship."" Yumi smiled, feeling guilty. ""It won""t. You won""t."" ""Are you sure?"" When Yumi nodded, Lyra jumped to her feet. ""Great! Bye."" As she watched Lyra skip off, Yumi shook of her petty jealousy. How could she be so petty? Even Lyra had noticed how tense she was? She had to put it behind her. She could do this! She could! XANA""s Son 2 Ulrich frowned as his sister polished off the last of her third latte. He replayed her request in his head. ""Run that by me again, Lyra. You want me to what?"" ""Help me catch a cyber prankster.",3439302
2985,"I swear, now, even if you don""t like it, I will join you in the stars above me."" The loud rustling sounded that came from the forest made his heart skip in shock. Immediately he pulled on a calm, resigned face when he gazed upon the arriving party. ""It""s you. You""re still alive?"" The she-wolf walked gracefully across the field. Her voice was smooth and seductive; although she seemed less powerful than before, the sheer fact of dread emanated faithfully remained. ""I know you, I do."" The wolf""s voice seem to have a duel tone to it when she spoke, ""If you want to die, truly die, then I can do something better for you. You will thank me for it."" ""What would that be?"" he knew this was trouble, the wolf was dangerous. She""s the being that controlled Elizabeth, his ""rival"" in love and master torturer. Pushed to the edge of reason, his common sense was being manipulated masterfully. ""You""re evil, why should I listen to you? I""ll only get myself into deeper trouble."" The wolf trotted closer, the soft black fur wisped by his skin. She felt like a silk blanket as the beautiful yet deadly creature laid her body on top of his. The warmth he felt was so calming, he couldn""t help himself. The touch of someone temperate reassured him. The back of his mind screamed at him, ""Stop! You""ll regret this! You will...' and yet, his body was too tired to care. His mind was exhausted, overexerted and ran through the mill as he found and lost his true love in one glorious day. The words of love he longed to hear from Yuuri rang in his ears, over and over again. It wouldn""t leave him alone; dogging him, pestering him only to point out the hopelessness he felt in his life right now. The she-wolfs tongue licked his face, instantly, Wolfram felt a difference inside. His memories, emotions and worries were pushed back and once more he felt himself being pulled into the reality he didn""t want to face. ""I can help you forget,"" she cooed. ""I... I don""t..."" he couldn""t get the words out. This was wrong, the wolf""s entire existence was a lie; created only to serve as a rod with the dark powers that be, and the world it cannot touch directly. ""You will forget, and everything will be as it once was. Except, you will be in control. Nothing like this will ever happen again. You can protect the ones you love, instead of the other way around."" He""s torn between his honor and the true love of his lifeHe prayed for both but was denied ""No, I-""again, but this time, his resistance was getting weaker. Her words drew him in like a mythical siren to men cast away at sea. The more she talked the calmer and more relaxed he felt. He was so tired, so very tired of this life. And her promising words drew him in like a moth to a flame. Enticing and the easy way out; he felt like a coward now. ""You can take revenge on the world that has abandoned you, Wolfram. Take control - and, make it a safer place to live. Under your reign: as the greatest king since the times of the Original King.""",583994
1769,"He watched as his girlfriend and her sister were ripped in half by that monster. And he was powerless to stop it. ""No... No... NO!"" Brick sat up in bed next to Blossom in cold sweat and actual terror. He swiped his hair back from his forehead and looked around. They were still at the Utonium house, still safe, and still together. Then why did it all feel so real? he wondered. It had felt too real. Too edgy... Too close to what could happen... Was he that shaken by the last time? He sat there and agonized over this for a while, until Bloss shifted next to him. ""Mmm... Brick...? What are you doing up...?"" Bloss asked sleepily. ""Nothing... Just a little thinking..."" Brick brushed off. She frowned as she shook off the dreamy state she was in. ""No... I know that look... It""s the same one you got the day Butch had to go into surgery to get his tonsils taken out... You""re scared."" Brick sighed. ""No hiding from you..."" He helped her sit up, and ignored the was she looked in her pink camisole and red shorts. ""It""s the monster... I can""t shake the feeling something bad is going to happen... Even our cats bailed town! I feel like I""m gonna lose you again..."" ""Again?"" Bloss giggled. ""Brick, you never lost me... And you never will..."" She cupped his cheek and arched up to kiss him, melding their mouths and putting his fears to bed. Speaking of bed... He deftly adjusted their positions so that he was looming over her. ""Woman, you make my blood boil... Another one of those and I""m going to deflower you before we even go on our third date."" ""What happened to our second date?"" He rested his forehead on hers. ""Just go with it please? I""m dying over here surround by the smell of you..."" ""Okay..."" And so they snuggled back into bed, hugging each other tightly. Brick absently rubbed her back as he thought about his dream. ""Unlikely..."" he chuckled. He""d make sure they survived... Boomer laid back in Bubbles"" bed, thinking of the battle yet to be waged tomorrow. Bubbles was curled up into his side, absently doodling on his bare chest. ""I just can""t shake the feeling that everything will change tomorrow..."" Bubbles murmured. Boomer twirled a lock of her blonde hair around his finger. ""I feel it too... But I know that as long as you smile at me when the battle""s gone, I""ll be fine."" Bubbles scooted up to place a kiss on his cheek. ""You are such a sweet talker."" ""Sweet talkers only get kisses on the cheek now?"" Boomer feigned hurt. ""Yep; and heroes get this,"" She planted a deep one on him, and grabbed her waist to hold her there longer. ""Sign me up for the next war, then..."" Bubbles thumped him on the chest. ""Pervert... One scare is enough..."" She rested her head on her chest and he let her resume what she was doing before. ""When we finish this, I have something I want to give you. It""s really important..."" ""I know I""ll accept it... As long as it isn""t a dead cricket."" She referred to the ""present"" he""d given her before leaving. ""No crickets..."" Boomer sighed. ""You know, I""m crazy about you, Bubbly-Boo."" ""I""m crazy about you too, Boo-Boo."" Bubbles smiled up at him.",3439302
670,"Then to the trio""s horror, they see Shapey with a flame thrower who just says, ""Noooooo!"" and Block with a huge jackhammer (the same one from ""Numb"") and says, ""Mine!"" Sure enough, the Amoeba boys are screwed! (Orel""s room) Clay puts on his pants and says, ""Well I always knew I deserved this but what did I do to earn that?"" Orel then says, ""Actually, I always wanted to know how it felt when I delivered the spanking this time."" Orel gets up and his pants fall off. Clay then says, ""By the way Orel? Whatever happened to the Devil?"" (Meanwhile) The girls drop Him off in a place that is like Marti Gras on a daily basis and everywhere he looked there were sinners and Catholics.

I""m going to stay here for a looooong tiiiiime! AND PARTY!"" And continues to party with the other sinners... and Catholics. Then Him is in a parade and throws beads at women and they flash him and he pretty much stayed in Sinville for a very long time, unable to cause trouble anywhere. So once again, the day is saved... thanks to... Moral Orel! AMEN! (Epilogue) THE CITY OF MORALTON... And after a few weeks after the Him incident...MOJO JOJO IS ATTACKING THE TOWN!

Then the Moralton citizens grab Mojo and strip him of his weapons and jetpack and then as Dr. Potterswheel prepares his euthanizing equiptment Mojo Jojo then shouts, ""Hey...what are you doing?"" Mojo sees the needle and he continues, ""Oh no... You""re not going to...If you are then why? All I was doing was destroying your town!""

Buttercup then says, ""Yeah yeah Mojo."" Bubbles then says, ""How about we go back to Townsville and let you go, you already suffered though here!""

1740,"""Sorry, it""ll take some um... time,"" I said, sheepish. Averill looked between us both, all giddy and smiling. I gave her one last hug and said, ""Take care of your brother, okay? He""s useless without us."" ""I will, now get before the heat of the day comes,"" Averill giggled and smacked me on the shoulder. I was going to miss her. As Tyrion led me to the carriage and Bronn helped me inside, it started to hit me. I""d said goodbye to the others the night before, since I didn""t think I could bare it in the morning (Averill insisted on seeing me off). But as the carriage pulled away from the farm, it pulled back at me keenly. The Eddars farm was the only real home I knew, and the longest one I""d ever had at fifteen solid years. Mother and I had never been further than shouting distance from each other, even after she died, but now with every step of the horse""s pulling the carriage, that distance grew. ""You""ve been quiet,"" Tyrion mused, sipping a glass of wine from a compartment in the carriage. I took a moment to look around the carriage for the first time since we""d boarded. It was of obvious Dornish make, with wide windows with pulled back sheer silk curtains on both sides. A table was built into the floor between them, covered in a fine cloth. It was ornate and expensive - I was sure some of the decorative fastenings were real gold - and all swirls and curved, polished wood and it made me shift uncomfortably on my plush seat. ""I-I""m sorry, milord..."" He shot me a look, ""... Tyri... Father. It""s just that this is... a lot to take in."" Tyrion had visited the farm every day in the week before we left, spending long hours discussing my mother and myself, our likes and dislikes. He gave me names to put to my mother""s stories; his late brother Jaime being the one who tracked down her would-be rapers while Tyrion soothed my mother when they first met, the drunk septon they""d found to marry them, and everything else. We never talked about the final night, when Tywin destroyed their short-lived marriage. For us, it was only the happier times. But now I was faced with my father""s wealth. I knew it would be nothing to what I would see at King""s Landing, but it was still so much... He seemed to sit a little straighter when I called him Father. It wasn""t an often occurrence, not yet, ""Aye, it would be for a peasant girl, wouldn""t it?"" Tyrion tilted his head a bit, studying me in a long enough silence to be uncomfortable, ""But you don""t seem in awe of it, like I""d have thought of a bastard raised low-born. You look scared, Synne."" ""Mother taught me never to trust money or titles,"" I played with my entwined fingers for a moment, then looked out at the sand dunes of Dorne, ""That gold is impressive and shiny and silk is beautiful to look at, but that""s all they are."" My gaze dropped. I remembered some of the things she said exactly, """"People are what matters, not things, Synne. Even Kings can be monsters""."" ""Tysha was a good woman,"" Tyrion said, voice low, ""So you""re scared of wealth and power?"" I shook my head, ""No, just weary of them.""",748687
3136,"""More like you ran right into the cozy arms of your rich married boyfriend."" the jealous researcher muttered low in tone. Jed frowned, confused. ""Pardon?"" Max frowned. It wasn""t the first time people mistook her closeness with Terrence ""Terry"" McGinnis as a secret affair. Many even viewed her as the reason Dana Tan-McGinnis moved into a condo downtown. What they didn""t understand was that she was best friends with both Dana and Terry. While Terry tended to stay more local, Dana however, travelled frequently to extinguish problems in her steadily growing fashion brand. She couldn""t be photographed as often with Dana as with Terry and Lexi. It irked her, but she rarely let it color her mood. ""Now that""s rich,"" piped Lexi from behind the pair, having made her way back. ""Coming from a two-bit scientist who only keeps his job due to heavy handed nepotism."" ""Wha-Who-?"" Lakewood whirled around only to come nose to nose with Lexi. In her four inch heels, she was the same height, if not taller than the red-faced scientist. ""Lexi,"" Max said. ""Who is this?"" Jed asked. Lexi supplied her hand for a shake and a warm smile. ""Alexis McGinnis, Dr. Gibson""s goddaughter and guest for the night. I expressed an interest in the neuroscience HartCore Medical is displaying tonight, and Aunt Max allowed be to tag along."" She tactfully ignored Lakewood and Langley. Max stifled a snort of laughter as she registered all of what Lexi said. Expressed an interest. That was a lie. Max had had to call in all her saved favors and promise her copious amounts of shrimp puffs to come tonight. Her goddaughter was a hell of an actress though, and she""d done her homework. ""Ah, a wonderful study, so full of uses and endeavors. It could potentially help to eradicate neurological diseases."" Jed beamed as if it were his own theory. ""I know the lead scientist Rebecca Klein."" ""I was hoping to hear about some more practical uses to the machine they""re unveiling, such as helping identify and aid in the cure for NDD."" Lexi imparted. Neurodegeneration Disease, a new form of disease that had become common in the past couple of decades. No one was actively seeking to cure it, the only methods available highly experimental and dangerous. Jed blinked and Lexi explained how she thought it could work. ""Well...My word, child. Becca has yet to even think that far. You have the makings of a scientist already. Might I interest you in an internship in a couple of years."" Lexi blushed and waved him off. ""Oh, no. All that wasn""t me. Aunt Max has been going on and on about how revolutionary the machine could be. I mean, the applications are endless. I""m sure Dr.s Langley and Lakewood have already told you all of this."" Lakewood looked shamefaced, and Langley was too busy trying to figure out the price tag of Lexi""s black and scarlet knee-length off the shoulder dress. ""Well, no I-"" Lakewood was interrupted by the sudden announcement that the benefit would soon begin. ""We""d better get to our seats then."" Jed sighed. ""We""ll talk later, Max dear. Such an intelligent and boisterous goddaughter you have.""",3439302
3089,"If you become food for a gigantic beast, so be it."" Monique told him bluntly, leaving Randy to wonder if that was her version of a mean joke or if she was actually being serious. ""Oh...that wouldn""t happen. The G-Man""s got my back. He""d come if we were in any real danger."" Randy said, but his voice was clearly unsure. ""You really want to believe that, oui? I suggest leaving your fantasies on this boat and accepting the harshness of the real world for once."" Monique replied as she began to put on her diving flippers. Quietly obtaining a diving suit from a nearby closet, Randy couldn""t help but feel discouraged at Monique""s words. ""Leave my fantasies on the boat...there goes all my fun."" Randy mumbled under his breath as put one leg into the diving suit and pulled up. Though he was excited about the prospect of this little mission with Monique, he couldn""t help but have a bad feeling about the whole idea... ""Okay, I gotta be honest. I""ve been having a bad feeling about this whole idea since we got out of the river."" Randy said as he looked down on his scanner, wondering when the blip they were looking for would show up already. ""Then you should have stayed back on the boat."" Monique replied as she made her way up the large, grass-covered hill. Randy followed suit, checking his watch, only to find that it was nearly midnight. It had taken them a good hour to get from the Heat-Seeker to where they were now. He had a feeling it was going to be a long night. When they got to the top of the hill, Monique pulled out a pair of binoculars and surveyed the landscape. She assumed something that Elsie had probably figured out at the scene; there was a good chance the creature could be nocturnal, based on the fact that it had yet to be seen during daylight. The French agent hoped that she could take it out quickly with the firepower Randy was lugging along, but her arrogance was still affecting her thought process. She had an urge to prove Dr. Tatopoulos wrong more than anything else. ""Nothing ahead. Any sign of the creature on the scanner?"" Monique asked, but Randy just shook his head as he tapped the screen with his finger. ""I got zilch over here. Maybe it""s busted or something. This is Craven""s work after all."" Randy suggested, but his attempt at another joke fell flat. Monique just put her hand on her forehead and wondered if it would have been a better idea to leave Randy behind and risk Nick finding out about her excursion. ""I""ve checked the surrounding area, and there""s another farm residence nearby. If the creature has a similar feeding pattern, we might be able to ambush it while it""s attempting to get its next meal."" Monique stated, and a click accompanied her statement as she turned off the safety on her energy rifle. ""Lead the way."" Randy replied, and the French agent nodded at him before going into a full sprint towards the cornfield ahead. Not wanting to get left behind, Randy ran after her. The bag on his back felt heavier with every new step. He really wished he wasn""t the one carrying all the equipment in this venture.",967934
2715,"I should probably leave-"" Saitama said awkwardly, but the two espers were too focused on their heated argument. ""What- I can""t believe you! Friends are not assets that are only there during battles or fights! Friends are there for you in whatever situation you are in! Friends are like family!"" Fubuki exclaimed as she felt tears forming in her eyes. Somehow, the word family struck Tatsumaki. It""s been a long time since she last saw their foster parents. Maybe, just maybe, Fubuki was looking for a family to belong to once more. But isn""t she enough family for her sister? This confused the petite esper as she shook her head. ""And you!"" Fubuki snapped at Saitama as she pointed a finger at him. The bald hero pointed at himself, confused. ""Me?"" he muttered. ""We""ve known each other longer than my sister and you considered her as your friend? Whereas you only saw me as an acquaintance? Is it because she""s stronger than me?! Is that it?!"" the raven-haired esper said, her voice cracking. Saitama could only blink. ""Ah. No. It""s actually much deeper than that."" he replied. His real reason for accepting Tatsumaki as his friend is because of her past. He had to consider her as his friend to help the small esper understand the meaning camaraderie. And it""s not all bad being friends with her anyway, he thought. Fubuki gritted her teeth as she turned on her heel and walked towards the door. ""It""s a real freaking treat to be your little sister."" she said before slamming the door shut using a wave of her hand. The two heroes were now left alone, speechless. They simply stared at the door. ""Gee, I kind of felt bad for Fubuki."" Saitama said as he scratched the back of his head. On the other hand, Tatsumaki could only remain speechless. ""Tats?"" the other hero said, making the green-haired esper snap from her thoughts. She looked up at him before staring at the opposite direction. ""I think I need to clear my head for a bit."" she muttered. ""Oh. I""ll be going then."" Saitama said as Tatsumaki nodded and walked towards her living room, not even dismissing the bald hero. Realizing that she was too shaken to see him out, Saitama left Senritsu Tatsumaki""s apartment. ""Sensei, you seem troubled."" Genos said, looking up from his notebook. Saitama then blinked as he glanced at the blond cyborg. ""Ah, was I? I was just thinking about the sale in City C. The supermarket""s located in a popular neighborhood, so it might be difficult to shop tomorrow."" he answered. Of course Saitama already knows what his ""disciple"" would reply. ""Then I shall assist you, sensei! I swear on my grave that I would successfully gather all the necessary items that you would be listing-"" ""Yeah, yeah I get it. You can come along."" Saitama said, interrupting Genos. He really didn""t want the cyborg to get into another monologue. ""It""s an honor, sensei!"" Saitama nodded as a reply before he went back to the manga he was reading. Before he could turn the page, Genos spoke up once again. ""I""ve read yesterday""s paper, and you made news alongside with Tatsumaki-san.",2750536
1431,"Hikaru, to his credit, didn""t flinched under her subtle scrutiny, instead extending the sweet box to Kouko. ""I brought some dessert in thanks,"" he said. ""Thank you for your consideration,"" she said. ""Dinner will be ready in another fifteen minutes - you and Akira can enjoy some tea while you wait. I""m sure you have plenty to talk about."" Akira turned right around to fetch cups of tea before his mother even had to ask. He was familiar with her style and doing things before she asked would win him points. His mother followed him out, offering that beneficent smile that indicated her approval. He returned quickly enough, not surprised to see Hikaru with his legs tucked back under the kotatsu. Akira took the place across from his friend, setting down the cups. ""Your mother..."" Hikaru shook his head, looking a bit flummoxed. ""Definitely not what I was expecting."" ""Oh?"" He raised an eyebrow. ""Why would someone like her marry your father? Was it arranged or something?"" Akira blinked, then took a sip of his tea as an excuse to gather his thoughts. The thought had occurred to him as well; Kouko was significantly younger than his father, and still a very attractive lady. His father, garrulous by nature, didn""t have the kind of personality that would attract females. But as far as Akira knew, the marriage hadn""t been arranged. ""She met him at an amateur Go competition,"" he said. ""Really? So she likes Go, too?"" Akira couldn""t help laughing at that. ""Probably as much as my father or I. I think she married him because he was the top professional."" ""Wow."" Hikaru""s eyes wandered off to the side, an indication he was thinking heavily. ""She sounds really awesome. I mean, the only girl I know who""s any good at Go is Nase, but I don""t think she loves go well enough to marry a geezer..."" ""Thanks,"" Akira said dryly. It was no secret that his father was on the wrong side of ancient, and Akira had learned not to be defensive about his father""s advanced age. ""Try not to bring it up like that during dinner, okay?"" Hikaru gave a wicked grin. ""What will you give me?"" ""I""m supposed to bribe you for good behavior?"" Akira retorted. ""How about allowing you to get into the salon without paying?"" ""I already get.... oh. So not fair."" Hikaru took a drink of his tea, wearing a comical pout. The only proper response to that was to roll his eyes at Hikaru""s childishness. ""Seriously, Hikaru... try not to rise to the bait when my father teases you. It""ll make dinner go much more smoothly."" Ten minutes later, his parents joined them for the meal. The dishes were perfectly presented - as if his mother would allow anything less - and they picked up their chopsticks and eagerly dug in. The food tasted just as good as it looked, and Akira found his body relaxing as he enjoyed the meal. Maybe this wouldn""t turn out that badly. Then his father spoke. ""So, Shindou-kun, have you given any thought to taken the pro exam? My offer to sponsor you is still open,"" his father said. He was smiling in a none-too-pleasant fashion, indicating an ulterior motive.",1112924
1192,"A strange feeling, so foreign to me after so long, erupted in my stomach. I was so close, so close to giving in... his hands trailed up my bare arms and I shivered. They ghosted up my neck and everything felt warm, electric even. France shifted, and for a split second the cage his arms made around me was lifted. I bolted, ducking under his arm and flying off the bed. I winced when I twisted my wrist, crumpling to the floor off the side of the bed. But I had to get away; France wasn""t supposed to make me feel like this anymore. He wasn""t supposed to make me so vulnerable. He wasn""t supposed to make me love him so much. ""Sesel..."" France turned slowly but didn""t leave the bed, ""Mon amour, what-"" ""Non!"" I gripped the sides of my head, backing away from him until my head hit the far wall, ""Non, non, non! Arrêtez l""alarme!"" ""Victoria, ce-"" I heard the bed groan as France got off, but didn""t care. What right did he have to do this to me? The French Empire started the war. The French Empire took my islands, my home, my people away from me. He took everything, so why... Why couldn""t I hate him? ""NON!"" I had to get out. I had to. The fact I was in the middle of a French Empire encampment meant nothing. I couldn""t be in the same room as him. I wouldn""t let him make me feel like this... He moved, and I lunged for the door, fiddling with the rusted lock. I had to get out. Had to get out. Run away. Hide. Get away from France. Run, run, run away... ""Je t""aime!"" France yelled. My hand froze on the knob, just as I managed to get the lock open. Did he... did France just say he loves me? ""Sesel..."" Footsteps. Oh gods; I couldn""t move. I was frozen, his every word washing over me. His voice was low and frustrated and just a bit husky. I didn""t jump when his hand shot out from behind me, plucking mine from the door. France wrapped his strong arms around me, pulled me back against his chest, and leaned his head down to my shoulder, ""... Je t""aime, Victoria..."" France held me tightly in his arms, and I just stood there, too shocked to move a muscle. He nuzzled the crook of my neck and planted a light kiss there, causing a shock to flow through me. I gasped, broken from my shock. France chuckled sadly, ""Je t""aime... if you believe nothing else, mon amour... believe that. Don""t... don""t run away from me anymore."" He choked, and my eyes widened as he shook with sobs, ""Je ne pouvais pas le prendre... I. Love. You."" France punctuated every word, and I could feel them pierce my soul, ""Mon dieu... Seychelles, I need you."" ""F-Francis..."" The way he spoke - with such conviction, such emotion - left me breathless. France loved me. Francis Bonnefoy loved me. France""s arms tightened, and he trailed his lips from my ear, down my neck, and back up, ""S""il vous plait... s""il vous plaît, ne me quitte plus."" He was begging. Begging me not to go. Didn""t he know I couldn""t after he said that? Told me he loved me?",748687
2964,"Her eyes widened and she looked back at me, ""R-really? You""re Morgan?"" This threw both of us. I turned to look at Morgan; he had a surprised look on his face that mirrored my own. ""What do you know about me?"" He asked. She shrugged, ""Nurse and Mr. Reynolds gave me ne-newspaper clippings sometimes; th-they were all about Spencer and the FBI. Th-they would tell me stories about y-you all sometimes too..."" ""Morgan,"" I said, looking at him pointedly. He nodded, saying ""I""m on it"" before flipping open his cellphone and leaving, but not before flipping open the window blinds so he could see inside. Morgan needed to tell the others about this; see if they found anything about us at the church. Once he left, I turned to Nephilim again, ""This is important, Nephi; why did they want me?"" She looked at her, her big red eyes so painstakingly innocent I felt like crying again, ""Because you fit the profile."" I froze, my eyes widening. I... fit the profile? What profile? I searched through my head for anything that could even slightly resemble a profile. A profile, like the hundreds and thousands of ones the team and I had given in the past... ""The donors had to match a specific height, weight, hair color, eye color, hair length, IQ..."" ""What... what profile?"" I managed to choke out as Morgan came back in. Prentiss had been talking about the donors Reynolds had been using to... to impregnate... her. It was even hard to think it. Morgan""s eyebrows shot up; he""d heard me, ""Profile?"" Nephilim nodded and then buried her head in her knees, wrapping her arms tighter around them, ""Mmm-hmm. That""s what the Nurse that took care of me called it. The Oracle called it the ""guidelines""."" ""Nephi,"" I reached forward and as gently and slowly as I could unwrapped her arms from her knees. She looked up at me slowly, ""This is really important. Do you know this profile and can you tell me what it is?"" She squirmed uncomfortably, ""U-um... I""m not supposed to tell you..."" It was frustrating that she didn""t want to tell me, ""Nephilim, it""s okay to tell me."" ""But... b-but,"" Her voice got higher, ""They""ll hurt me again. They""ll hurt me... then they""ll kill the babies again!"" She was on the edge of hysterics again. I could hear her heart race from the monitor; she needed to stay calm or the doctor would kick us out. ""Hey, hey, it""s okay..."" Morgan took a step towards the bed. She jumped and squealed, scooting away from him and towards me. I shot a look at Morgan and he stopped; the doctor said that she wouldn""t let anyone get near her. It seemed Morgan was no different... but why was I? We waited silently until Nephilim calmed down. Once her heart rate returned to normal, I smiled reassuringly the best I could and looked down at her, ""Nephilim, I won""t let anyone hurt you. You""ll be fine."" ""A... are you sure?"" She looked up at me trustingly. ""Have I ever lied to you?"" Nephilim pretended to think about it for a minute, then nodded, ""Yeah; when I caught you try-trying to make me a cake for my birthday. You said it was f-for Mrs. Reid.""",748687
278,"Inside were two tickets to London Heathrow Airport (LHR) in London, England. Also included was a small reminder to take the Heathrow Express to Paddington station as a connection to their final destination (which wasn""t named). Before Randy could continue his line of questioning, Brad interjected. ""Do you trust me?"" ""What does that have to do with anything?"" Randy asked, but Brad only repeated his question. Randy looked again at the two plane tickets, then at his older brother. ""We both know I""ve been keeping things from you, but there isn""t anything I can do right now, except..."" Brad trailed off, taking a few moments to check his mirrors and start the car. Once they were on the road, he continued. ""Do you trust me?"" There was more to this question than a simple answer of trust, much more, but Randy couldn""t put his finger on it. When Randy remained silent, Brad started talking again. ""Those tickets are for 11 pm,"" Brad slowed the car down at the red light. ""In two hours, we""ll be on a flight to England. But I need you to answer me."" Brad looked directly into Randy""s eyes. That""s when it clicked; when Randy knew what Brad was asking. Even though there were so many unanswered questions, so much Randy didn""t understand... the only thing Randy knew for sure was that Brad was scared. To the disconcerting eye, he looked calm and collected as usual. But randy wasn""t just anyone. This time it was Randy""s turn to lean over and kiss his lover on the lips. When Randy pulled back, he gave Brad what he hoped was a reassuring smile. As with the whirlwind of everything else that had happened in the past few weeks, Randy decided to just go with it. He nodded in response to Brad""s question. ""The airport isn""t far away, and it shouldn""t take long to pack up our things back at the-"" ""No!"" Brad shouted frantically. When Randy shot him an odd glance, Brad tried to recompose himself. ""We can""t."" Brad pulled off to the side of the road. This time, it seemed he couldn""t bring himself to look Randy in the face. ""Brad..."" ""This never happened,"" Brad mumbled quietly. ""All of this..."" ""This what? Us?"" Randy asked, beginning to panic. ""Oh god no!"" Brad denied quickly. ""No! Never that. Just..."" ""Everything else?"" Randy suggested. Brad nodded quietly. Randy noticed his brother""s hand beginning to shake. It was that fear again. Yet as much as Randy wanted to know the truth, he had resolved himself to trust Brad. If playing in ignorance was what Brad wanted, then Randy would oblige. Randy unbuckled his seatbelt and reached over the middle arm rest, wrapping his arms around Brad""s neck. Randy tucked his head just under Brad""s chin. ""Randy...?"" Brad asked hesitantly. Randy didn""t respond, merely waited for Brad to understand. After a few minutes, Brad finally wrapped his arm around Randy""s small body, tightening his hold as if afraid that Randy would slip away. ""I would follow you to the ends of the earth,"" Randy said. That was all the answer Brad needed. Notes: This is a super short (transition) piece, because I wanted to post something after skipping the last two weeks.",583994
3482,"There was Jimmy, just a few yards away, and yet he seemed unreachable. I knew I just had to take another few steps, or call, but I stood frozen to the ground and wondered why Jimmy didn""t turn around. It seemed to me as if he should sense my presence over a mile. This turned out to be true a moment later when Jimmy slowly turned his head and looked at me. Jimmy: I don""t know what made me turn around. Maybe I had heard her footsteps, or I had seen a shadow. Or I had sensed her, who knows. Anyway, suddenly I felt the urge to turn around, for I was sure that someone was standing there. So I turned, and there was Yves. She didn""t speak or move, she just looked at me, and I met her gaze. Although the thoughts were rushing through my head, I remained calm. Just one look, and she and I reconnected. It was amazing. I looked at her, and her dark, deep eyes looked back at me, and none of us said a word. We didn""t need to say anything. I noticed that she seemed to tremble slightly, and then I knew that she was feeling the same about me. Yves hadn""t forgotten anything. Slowly, I got up, and at the same moment, Yves covered the distance between us with a few steps. She stopped beside me and looked at the memorial. ""I""ve been thinking a lot of them lately,"" she said eventually. Her voice was very quiet. ""They were fighting for a good thing, weren""t they?"" ""Sure they were,"" I answered. ""I still miss them. Don""t you?"" ""I do,"" said Yves. And then we fell silent again. She was standing beside me, and I knew it would take me only a minimal movement to touch her, and still it would look coincidental. But I didn""t want to play games. This was serious. It was the most serious thing I ever had to face. ""I saw those agents,"" Yves said. ""Doggett and Reyes."" ""They were here,"" I said. ""I talked to them for a while."" And we fell silent again. This time, the silence lasted a lifetime, it seemed, and I decided I couldn""t wait any longer. ""Yves..."" Yves finally turned her head to look at me. ""Jimmy, I""m sorry,"" she said. ""I know my behavior must have been mighty strange, and I want to apologize."" ""Don""t,"" I said, and my voice was husky. My heart was a heavy lump in my throat. Yves made as to speak again, but I shook my head. ""Don""t,"" I said again. ""I don""t want an apology. If you apologize, it means that there""s something that you regret. Tell me, Yves, is there anything you regret?"" I held her gaze, and after a moment she lowered her eyes and shook her head. ""No,"" she said. ""I don""t regret anything apart from the fact that I never answered your calls and constantly tried to avoid you. But I can explain..."" ""I don""t want an explanation now,"" I interrupted her. ""Yves, I just want you to know that I""m here. Right now. I""m with you, and it""s entirely up to you whether it will be the last time or not. Whatever you""ll say, I""ll accept your decision. I know how I feel, and I guess so do you, but no matter if you reciprocate those feelings or not, I don""t want to lose you. This is the most important thing of all. I""m not going to lose you again, Yves.""",240213
544,"the Disciplinary Committee Chair complimented, leaving Takaharu speechless as Omiko fumed in shock and surprise beside him. ""Let me see that!"" she commanded, taking the paper without thinking right from Gamagoori""s hand. Most of No-Stars gasped as she made her death wish, but surprisingly, Gamagoori simply allowed her take it. Perhaps it was because he knew what would happen when she did. As Omiko turned it towards her, a blast of vibrant yellow light blinded her as she gazed upon the sheer beauty of Takaharu""s perfect writing. ""Agh, it""s...it""s too much!"" she admitted, her eyes almost burning before she finally threw the paper aside onto the floor, where Gamagoori delicately picked it up a moment later. The Elite Four member shook the dust off from the paper, but surprisingly kept his patience despite Omiko""s indignation. ""You could learn something from this boy, Hakodate. I noticed that your r""s in particular were sloppy. One can only wonder how good your tennis hand could really be if you cannot write a simple r correctly."" he told the twin-tailed girl quite matter-a-factly, leaving her to grumble in annoyance at being called out. ""Sanageyama was right to expect much from you, Fukoroda. Continue to impress me, and I""ll make sure you have a One-Star Uniform."" he told the young boxer, who simply smiled as he stood up again, holding back fierce but happy tears. ""Yes, Gamagoori-sempai! Thank you for your kind words!"" Takaharu replied with gratitude. Meanwhile Omiko just gritted her teeth. She couldn""t believe that all of Takaharu""s sucking up to Ira Gamagoori was actually working. She glared at the boxer in his triumph, her telescropic eye-piece focusing in on him. She was so focused, in fact, that she failed to notice how much pressure she was putting on the pencil in her hand. There was a loud snap as it broke into two pieces, which fell right to her feet. Gamagoori craned his neck up away from the papers upon hearing the noise with his sensitive ears. The moment he saw the pencil pieces on the floor, his eyes almost bulged. Omiko made a nervous grin, shaking in panic as his shadow covered her and her desk completely. Gamagoori than proceeded to bellowed so loud, it would no doubt make a rogue elephant cry. ""HAKODATEEEE!"" From the moment she stepped inside the Athletics clubroom as the very first person to arrive, Omiko Hakodate was sure that this day would be perfect. Now, as she began the long walk home to the No-Star slums, she was beginning to think this day was no longer going so well. It didn""t help that the club registration process took so long, and that Omiko wouldn""t even have a chance to see any prospective members for her club until tomorrow. And things were only made worse by the fact that Omiko had been forced to stay an extra hour to clean up the Athletics club-room, as punishment for breaking her pencil and interrupting Gamagoori""s train of thought. At least that was probably a light punishment compared to what Gamagoori had been known to dish out, she thought.",967934
1047,"Yuna Roma Seirin - He""s from Gundam Seed Destiny. Yuna is the fiancé of Cagalli. His motive for marrying Cagalli has something to do with Orb and the alliance. (I""m quite confused with this... so if anyone would be kind, please explain this more! please!) Athrun doesn""t like him, of course. In episode 13, Cagalli decided to marry him. I""ll leave it to you to discover what happened next. Ja! miriae Well, people, here""s the last part of this fic Hmmm.. will it end happily or sadly? Hmm... s s It is really an extraordinary thing to love. The bliss it gives you is unnerving- the blushes, the silent peeks, the unspoken words, the smiles and endearing words. And when all had been said, you""ll come down the isle and promise never to leave each other""s side. But is it possible to come down the isle without experiencing those? Yes, it is. Which is why I didn""t feel weird with what was happening now: I was walking down the isle, the wedding march playing in my ears, the white silky material that hugged my body trailed down behind me. Cameras clicked and flashed and all I had to do was let my happiest smile graze my lips. I was going to marry someone I don""t even love. Love was just a feeling for the weak- this is what he always told me. He told me that in order to help my country, I needed to do sacrifices. Before, I was confident with sacrifices. I was even capable of throwing my life for others. I wasn""t afraid of death. But now, the stakes of this sacrifice was just too great. I couldn""t just throw away my feelings for the person I love, it was just... too much to ask for. I know Athrun doesn""t love me anymore. I should be grateful, isn""t? It makes this sacrifice even easier. I would only be the one to suffer. At least, my sufferings will not be in vain for I know that my country will benefit for it. ""Do you, Cagalli Yula Attha, accept Yuna Roma Seirin as your husband, in sickness and in health, for better and for worse?"" Deep in my heart, I hoped for Athrun... that somehow, he""d be here to break this wedding.. that somehow he""ll come and kick the ass of Yuna, carry me bridal-style and steal me away from here and we""ll leave happily ever after. But then, it only happens in fairy tales. ""I do..."" My feelings for Athrun didn""t matter anymore. This is my battle and I have chosen my answer. In one way or another, I still hope to believe that love isn""t just for the weak. s s Chapter 3 ""Cause we""ll find the way s s It was one of those days when she loved the rain. The droplets of water that pours down her delicate skin felt nice, for one. The gray clouds that hung above her head simply supplemented the way she felt: Hurt, lost, but free. Which is why she could be found standing at the park, her wedding gown soaking wet, her hair dishelmed, a blank expression on her face. The sight of the empty park seemed to content her. It was a rare chance to have this park by yourself. Somehow, she thanked the rain. Nothing could bee seen on her golden orbs... they were lost and even her rational mind couldn""t kick in and advise her to go hide. Hide, you ask?",560480
2451,"Tiger stood up in front of the large beast. ""Rudolph being...lemme"" guess, Windstorm Knight?"" Tiger raised an eyebrow to the wolf, much to the amusement of Garm. ""How receptive, Master Tiger. Few have recognized my master""s real name..."" Tiger winked an eye at his brother. ""It pays to listen to Christmas songs."" Byakko only gave a snort as a reply. Garm""s tone suddenly became serious. ""We must make haste, young Masters. My master grows impatient with each passing second. I advise you to ride amongst my tribe."" he said, motioning for his two companions. Byakko and Tiger boldly sat into their backs as the rode like the wind across the frozen, snowy tundra that was Lutie. ""Soooo...you""re the brothers I have been expecting...."" Windstorm ran an examining eye at both of them, his gaze fluidly going up and down both of them. Both felt uncomfortable, and Tiger would have given an arm to bash the lecherous MVP had not Byakko given him the ""eye"". ""You""re gonna be the next MVPs?"" Both nodded at him, surprised by the skeptical look Windstorm gave both of them. They were even more surprised when Windstorm rolled on the floor, clutching his stomach and laughing off, looking as if his nose would have rolled off from the intensity of the laughter. His sword and shield fell noisily on his side as he rolled off to la-la land. To which both brothers looked irritated and annoyed. ""THAT""S IT! I have the right mind to bash that silly nose off of your snout, ya mangy horned reindeer reject!"" Tiger snarled as Byakko restrained his brother. ""Whoa! Down boy! Down! Sir Knight, my apologies about my brother..."" Byakko said in frustration but was abruptly cut short upon the maddening glint that Windstorm developed after hearing the comment. ""Oh, a smart mouthed boy do we have here? Well then, I would like to bash that appalling goody-goody face of yours, but I would like to settle for your brother instead...""Windstorm smiled at Byakko, who stared in shock as is Tiger. ""Wha...Wha? Fuck you, red nose! It""s me that""ll pummel ya to bits an"" pieces! You""re a fuckin coward ye"" are!"" Tiger began struggling again at his brother""s hold. ""Hmph! Simpering fool, I do realize that. However, I do know it will hurt you more if I hit on your brother would you? Besides, you""re not my type anyhow..."" Windstorm smirked, amused at Tiger""s reaction. Byakko relented on letting go Tiger, who stared wide-mouthed at him as he started the painful walk towards Windstorm. The reindeer raised a quizzical frosted eyebrow as the boy came a foot away from him... And gave him the hardest kick right where Windstorm""s you-know-what should have been. Byakko looked at him, thoroughly disgusted. ""That""s for your yaoi thoughts, you over-active, frost-covered, mangy, hornball! My brother""s right, I have the mind not only to pummel your nose, which by the way looks 5 sizes bigger than where your balls should be, but also you your prick of a snout which would look like a rotten cucumber once I am through with you!",583064
468,"Horus just matched his father""s facial expression, ""Like when you promised Magnus that Russ was only coming to detain him? Like you promised Curze that your surgery would cure him of his visions? When you promised Angron that you""d teleport his brethren away with him? When you gave Fulgrim that demon possessed blade and told him it was a reward? Frankly, papa, your track record is shit."" Perfect white teeth gritted as the Emperor took in Horus""s words and his tone became cloyingly sweet. ""Now Horus, there""s nothing that we can""t discuss as a father and a son. I""d never hurt my sons."" ""This is your last chance, father. Step down from your thrown- ""Now Horus,"" the Emperor ground out sweetly, ""Let""s not say anything we""ll regret."" ""Abdicate as the leader of humanity and destroy the imprisoned demons you call the chaos gods- ""Horus, you""re not listening to me."" The emperor warned, his attention fully turned away from the imprisoned eldritch gods. ""Go on trial for your crimes and face the laws that you- ""DON""T! YOU! EVER! TELL! ME! WHAT! TO! DO!"" The Emperor roared, slamming his fist down on the golden throne with every word; the force of the impacts causing earthquakes all over terra and seeming to frighten the imprisoned gods with the weight of his rage and anger. Horus however refused to cower before a tyrant. His cause was right and it would disrespect the memories of his dead or chaotic infected brothers Horus stood before his father, too frightened to run or attack; frightened of the most powerful human in existence and possibly the most powerful lifeform in the materium. Without warning, a look of remorse came over the Emperor""s face. ""Oh my son, I am so sorry. I don""t know what came over me."" As he did so, Russ sprouted several tentacles from random spots on his body; horns rising up out of his forehead and razor sharp fangs. Taking up his chainsword in a horribly mutated tentacle hand, he looked at Horus and bellowed ""BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD! SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE!"" The once King of Fenris and father of the wolves charged at his brother Primarch. Horus sidestepped the attack and struck at the back of Russ""s neck with a power fist. The blow should have shattered the Primarch""s diamond hard bones into powder but with the unnatural strength of Chaos he roared and slashed at his brother like a rabid animal. The Wolf King and Master of the Luna wolves clashed in a deadly dance around their father""s throne room. Their blades clashed with enough force that they could be heard across the planet, it could even be heard over the sound of chaos infected forces, the ""loyalists"" and the last remaining untainted members of Horus""s original rebellion. The Emperor watched it all with the same non-blinking eyes.",1220273

""Then, we explain that all of this is a big misunderstanding. Bubblegum would do that one for us."" The young Vampire Queen said. The three of them nodded in agreement and went on with their plans. Marceline floated to the Eastern side, Finn on the Western side and Jake on the Northern side. ""If none of us finds anything, go back here and we""ll go to the Southern side."" Marceline said. They went on with their respective directions to find the Vampire King and the Young Princess. Marshall Lee floated in the attic""s corner, the princess still on his arms.

Princess Bubblegum nudged a bit, making the Vampire King look down on her. ""It""s your fault, princess."" He said as he poked her cheek. ""What will you think of me now?"" He sighed and leaned on the corner""s wall. He brushed his hair using his free hand and placed it back to balance Princess Bubblegum on his arms. He closed his eyes for a bit and heard mumbling coming from down below. He looked down and saw the princess half-opening her eyes. ""W-wha? Where am I?"" she mumbled. ""Good glob, finally you""re awake!"" Marshall Lee said in relief. Princess Bubblegum looked around and suddenly, it hit her. ""Why am I in your arms, Marshall Lee?"" she asked. The young vampire smirked and leaned closer to her face, making the princess blush. ""Because you fell for me. And I simply caught you."" He teased. Princess Bubblegum laughed sarcastically and smacked his forehead. Marshall Lee touched his damaged forehead with both hands, releasing the princess. ""OWWW!"" ""You and your awful jokes!""

551,"People had been partying for days now without any sleep. Everyone was crashing and Peter being the good friend he was, got rid of all the fucking free loaders and kicked them out of the house. And that is where the story begins. Halloween morning, half an hour before sunrise Edward was feeling like shit. He thought that a weekend long orgy of drink and sex would make him feel any better but it didn""t. He was still sore, now it was physical as well as mental. Jasper was gone and the gaping hole in his heart was still oozing and raw. Miserably, he sat at the breakfast table on Halloween morning and regretted every single thing that happened over the weekend. In fact, he felt like a total slut as he sat before the steaming cup of coffee. He and Peter were sitting in the exact same spot as they""d done three days before Halloween. Edward was much the same except now he was utterly sleep deprived and his ass ached. Peter on the other hand was totally fucked up. Though he""d kicked out all the guests he was still hyper and a rabbit on speed. He was like a race horse on cocaine; pure energy and no way to vent it. Peter was twitching and wiping sweat form his brow as he gulped back an insane amount of coffee. ""Oh Edward,"" breathed while his eyes twitched, ""You wanna do something?"" Edward looked up at Peter like a sad puppy, then looked back down again, ""No."" It was final. Peter shook his head and failed to notice that his shirt was on backwards. He began to babble at a mile a minute, ""Because I can still keep going man. We could go trick or treating tonight, us together. We can get some guns and dress up like rappers or something-or is it rapists?-fuck it we""ll be okay."" ""But I don""t know about you but I did so much cocaine last night and I can""t shake it. I need a big fucking Hershey bar but I can""t leave the house or else you""ll kill yourself and I Can""t break your arms."" Edward looked around the house, littered with beer cans, pizza boxes and used condoms. ""Well Peter if you have energy why don""t you try cleaning up a little."" Peter shot up out of his chair and began to babble more, ""Sure man-clean-up, man-it"" what well do then we can go out and get some more coffee . . ."" And he just kept going on like that. Peter was like a robot, attacking the task of cleaning up the house with efficiency and tirelessness. It was a little disturbing how he cleaned up the used condoms with such enthusiasm but Edward wasn""t one to look a gift horse in the mouth. So the clean-up effort commenced. Edward naturally went to grab a black garbage bag but realized that those were all in the garage. It was dark outside though Edward walked slowly to avoid walking on the Halloween decorations that the guests from the party totally fucked up. As Edward walked in the dark pre-dawn hours, his stomach began to tell him something. Gagging and wrenching, Edward fell to his knees and threw up the large amount of alcohol he""s consumed in the recent time frame. As he knelt on the ground, it felt like he was vomiting his whole life out.",1220273
3580,"Reluctantly, almost embarrassed, Abel asked Caterina, ""Duchess, is it alright if you hear my confession? I would have gone to another priest or nun but,"" he swallowed as the words lodged in his throat, ""it would have felt dishonest to confess to anyone but you."" Caterina blinked and schooled her features into a more professional cast. ""Of course, Father Nightroad,"" she noticed that Abel cringed when she called him ""Father."" Undiscouraged, Caterina continued. Clearing her throat she began, ""How long has it been since your last confession, Abel."" Abel sighed. ""I have never been to confession, my lady."" He paused as if expecting a reprimand then went on. ""I have gone into the confessional booth multiple times and admitted nothing but bald faced lies to the priests."" Abel began to speak with more assertion as he let his sins out for the first time. ""I never once believed in any god or religion; no matter how much pain I or others felt and nothing I""ve seen has made me change my mind."" He breathed in deeply, a kind of rattling breath as if he were supressing tears. ""Not to mention the fact that your brother uses the confessional booths as a trap for spies to set. So no, I have never confessed my sins until now; until now I thought I could handle it on my own."" He ran a hand through his silver hair and continued. ""I merely pretend to believe in god in order to fit in with AX and the Vatican at large; I""ve been blessed to know many kind and righteous individuals here with AX."" ""I am over a thousand years old and to date I have personally murdered more than seven millions humans by my own two hands as well as numerous Methuselah, though there are no exact statistics regarding vampire fatalities,"" he spoke the words with such dryness as if they were always rattling around in his head, making noise all the time and driving him fucking nuts. ""My sibling and I were test tube babies created by the United Nations to lead the Red Mars Colonization project. We had no parents and if we failed to perform there was always a very real risk of being injected with sodium pentathol and replaced with a new batch."" Abel leaned forward in his chair, his manner and storytelling becoming crisper and more intense. Caterina knew most of this story, but mostly through bits and pieces of what Abel had dropped over the years; this was the first time he""d told his story in its entirety. ""During Armageddon, I, Seth and my brother Cane sided with the colonists while Lilith; the original crusnik sided with the terrans."" He paused to lick his lips, ""Lilith truly cared for all people; during her life she never even killed a vampire. She thought about more than just her own tribe but all tribes."" His voice became soaked in regret and bitterness; for Caterina had first found Abel in mourning for his beloved Lilith. ""I won""t bore you, your eminence,"" Abel continued, resuming his finger rubbing, ""I saw something recently which shook me."" Caterina was starting to understand what had Abel rattled, ""The incident with the homunculus in Venice.""",1220273
14,"Lire had confidence in his sunny personality, right? Might as well blind this guy with his personality. ""He-"" ""Piss off."" The guy automatically bit back, cold but not harsh. ""YOU LOOKIN"" FOR A FIGHT, BTCH?"" Jin immediately waved his fist, berserk at the scathing comment. Somehow, Jin suddenly felt a piercing gaze from behind him that sent shivers down his spine. He simmered down, laughing nervously. ""Sorry...that was rude."" The guy raised his knees to his chest, and lowered his head to rest on his arms. ""Can I...sit here with you?"" The guy didn""t look up, but he did answer. ""Do as you will."" Jin grinned, relieved at the docile answer. ""My name""s Jin."" He sat cross-legged, facing the boy...man, whatever. ""Dio."" Jin raised an eyebrow. ""D.O.?"" ""Dee-yoh."" The guy, whose name was Dio, looked up, a bit irritated. ""Sorry sorry."" Jin grinned again, all the while moving a bit closer. ""So where did the producers pick you up? They got me from the Silver Continent."" ""I""m from..."" Dio muttered.""...media..."" ""From where?"" Jin moved an inch forwards, as if straining to listen. ""A-Archaemedia."" Dio clipped, before hiding his head again. ""Cool!"" Jin exclaimed, making the guy raise his head a bit, with an unsure expression in his face. ""I mean, well, that""s quite a dangerous place. And you""ve been living there! That""s like, I dunno, that makes you have the coolest backstory!"" Dio reddened a bit, before hiding again. ""Because like, can you imagine? My group got decimated by lowbie monsters, and almost everyone else came from the lowbie islands too. Mari""s probably the one from the highest tier continent but she doesn""t remember her past, so that might as well be non-exis - "" Jin barely dodged the laser blast that was aimed for his butt. When he looked around, Mari was glaring at him, as she hid behind the still-smoking laser turret of her now-sand fort. ""Psycho woman."" Jin muttered, as he covered the smoking area with a lot of sand. ""Are all of your friends that scary?"" Jin did a double take. ""Scary?"" Jin didn""t bother hiding his snicker. ""Oh, man! Sorry, but you - the guy with horns and a claw - think they""re scary?"" Jin was now beside Dio, and wanting to get cozy with his almost-friend, slung a casual arm around the guy. ""Listen, what you should avoid are the girls. The red head there, her name""s Elesis. She""s a hot head so I""d advise you trying to cross her way when she""s mad."" He tilted his head to the group playing beach volleyball. ""The blond one is Lire, and she""s the mother of the group. Don""t be afraid to ask her anything, but I""m not sure why I can""t let my guard down around her."" Jin shook his head. ""The purple haired one is Arme. She""s funny and all, but she goes a little insane. Try to stay away as much as possible."" ""The pink-haired one is a childhood figure of mine. She""s Amy and she""s uh....violent. Especially when it concerns either Elesis or talks about her stardom. I""m sure you""ve heard of her since she does concerts everywhere."" Dio shook his head. ""No. First time I heard about her."" ""Wha?"" Jin looked shocked.",583064
3121,"Percy and Annabeth, they could survive almost anything, but... Nico shuddered as his own memories from Tartarus resurfaced. He had barely made it and he was a son of Hades. ""What are you going to do now?"" Chiron asked softly, the grief still in his voice, but slightly less now. Nico looked up and saw in Chiron""s eyes what he had dreaded most, forgiveness. ""I""ll lead Jason and the others to the House of Hades, to permanently seal the doors of death and save Percy and Annabeth."" Chiron nodded. ""Good luck. And Nico? For the sake of the world, succeed."" With that, the rainbow fizzed away and the water vapor dissipated into the air. Nico leaned heavily against. It had been both easier and harder than he had imagined. Slowly, he trudged back up to the mess hall where the others were waiting. They all glanced up as he entered the room. ""How did it go?"" Leo asked. ""Fine. Chiron already knew about the Romans."" ""Did he know anything about Tartarus?"" Jason asked. ""No. I don""t think so. He just said we needed complete the quest."" The others nodded. ""So... What should we do?"" Frank asked. No one volunteered any suggestions until Nico stated the obvious ""We have to get to the doors of death."" ""Yeah. In Greece, right?"" Piper asked though she knew the answer. Not waiting for Nico to answer, she continued. ""That""s about seven hundred miles from here, I think. Leo, can we make there?"" Leo considered the question. ""Yeah, the Argo II should be good. She took some damage, but for the most part everything""s fine."" Just as he finished speaking, the entire ship lurched to the left. All of them were thrown to the floor. ""What was that?"" Hazel asked, shakily getting to her feet. ""Venti,"" Jason said, grimly staring out the window at the storm spirits racing around. Leo groaned. ""Not those guys again! I thought we were done with them!"" Piper smiled and punched Leo""s arm. ""What""s wrong, Valdez? Not up to a fight?"" Leo sighed, but stood up. ""Let""s go kick some butt!"" Secretly, Nico was almost glad there was something to distract them from Annabeth and Percy, a smile appearing on his face, he followed the others out to the deck. A/N Next chapter, back to Percy and Annabeth! I""ve started to get a vague ideas for plot lines... (although I""ll admit my thoughts are shamefully skewered to Percy and Annabeth, but how am I supposed to help it after how Mark of Athena ended!?) Sorry about reusing the Venti, I know it""s kinda lame but they""re really the only wind monsters in Greek/Roman mythology I could find... oh well, I""ll try not to reuse anything else... So, love you all and please review! A/N Thanks to everyone who reviewed! Most of you were really nice (not all of you) and I want you to all know that I really really appreciate. Also, thanks to anyone who signed up to be alerted or favorite this story! A lot of people informed me that they did tell Chiron. Sorry about that... I am usually very good about checking my facts, and did think that that one might be wrong, but I didn""t want to reread the entire book to try and find it.",2943978
2574,"The baby moved his head, his mouth trying to reach Itachi""s finger. Startled, the young Uchiha retracted his finger while Minato clapped his hands over his mouth, suppressing an ""awwww"". The baby giggled. At that moment, Itachi envied Minato. Minato was two years younger and yet he was going to be an older brother before him? It was unfair! He wanted to have a baby too! But the question was how? Itachi had sought his father first, and asked, ""Father, how are babies made?"" His father""s eyes widened for a fraction, his lips pressed in a thin line as he replied tersely, ""Go ask your mother."" Which he did. But his mother had just laughed and ruffled his hair, ""Oh, Itachi, you""re too young for that!"" His mother and father would not tell him and so Itachi went to his godfather next. Kakashi""s lone eye widened before crinkling in a smile. ""Why do you ask that, Itachi?"" ""Because Minato""s going to have a younger brother soon and I want to have one too,"" the young boy replied seriously. ""Really now?"" Kakashi replied as he regarded the boy for a moment. With a deep sigh, he stood up and retrieved an orange book and a green book from his book shelf. He handed them to Itachi, ""Give these to your father and mother. Then you""ll have a baby brother-or sister-soon."" Itachi eyed the books suspiciously. ""Mother said these are bad books."" ""Bad books for children like you,"" Kakashi replied easily. ""So promise me you won""t ever take a peek inside, alright? Just give these to your parents and they""ll know what to do."" The young Uchiha still did not look convinced, ""Are you sure, Uncle Kakashi?"" ""Positive,"" the white-haired ninja replied with a thumbs-up. Itachi did what his godfather asked him to. His parents, however, were not pleased. Sakura had shrieked and cursed her bloody perverted sensei! as she broke the door to his apartment. She would have pulverized the whole place if Sasuke did not step in and said that he would deal with Kakashi himself. His father was calmer as he entered, activated his Mangekyo Sharingan and burned the orange and green books with Amaterasu. Kakashi""s wail of agony resounded loudly throughout Konoha. His Uncle Naruto even swore he heard it from the Hokage tower while Gai-sensei cried tears of joy upon hearing it when he entered the gates of Konoha, glad that his rival was still in the springtime of his youth. Ever since then, his Uncle Kakashi had never tried that trick again. However, Itachi thought the plan actually succeeded because nine months later, the lovable Uchiha Mikoto was born. Still, Itachi wanted another younger brother..and another younger sister.. and maybe another younger brother? He smiled. He wanted to be the best older brother ever! But to do that- -Itachi decided that he would need to borrow another orange book to give to his parents one of these days. Kakashi was able to rebuild his Icha Icha Paradise collection anyway. The End. And that""s the end folks! Yes, it""s NaruHina and SuiKa.",560480
1921,"Elle wouldn""t have been surprised if the skeleton started screaming. ""Okay everyone, don""t touch it,"" Brand said authoritatively, kneeling down and examining it. ""There""s nothing to worry about,"" Stef assured Andy, who was sobbing uncontrollably into her shoulder. ""You don""t understand!"" she gasped. ""Don""t be afraid. Deep breaths, deep breaths!"" she coached her friend. ""He""s dead for sure,"" Mouth quavered. ""I think it""s Chester Copperpot,"" Elle shook. ""Who?"" everyone asked. ""In the attic,"" she started. ""There was this article about a guy named Chester Copperpot. He went looking for the rich stuff in like, 1937. They saw him go in, but they never saw him come back out!"" A new thought struck Elle. ""Oh, God! If he didn""t make it out and he was an expert, what about us?"" ""We can""t be sure it""s him,"" Mikey said. ""I""m sure it""s him,"" Elle said firmly. ""I bet his I.D. ""s in his wallet. Someone get his wallet!"" Mikey dug through the skeleton""s satchel and produced the faded leather wallet. ""You""re right,"" he said grimly. ""Chester Copperpot,"" he flashed the I.D. at them. Everyone groaned. ""We""re gonna get killed!"" Data shouted. Mikey rummaged through the bag some more. ""Hey, look at this!"" he pulled out several wax-like rods. ""Candles!"" Data took them and ran off. ""Hey, where""re you going?"" ""I""m setting booty traps!"" he called back. ""Booby traps."" ""That""s what I said, booty traps!"" Brand rolled his eyes and was about to leave when his foot kicked something. ""Hey, guys, look,"" he gingerly lifted a medallion out of the dirt. ""It""s like a skeleton of One-Eyed Willy or something."" ""Give me that. Give me this,"" he added to the skeleton. The medallion was attached to a long piece of twine around Chester""s neck. Mikey tried to remove it, and Chester""s head came off. Everyone yelped. Brand quickly replaced the skull onto the neck and wiped his hands on Mouth""s jacket, who looked like he was about to cry. ""Hey, guys. Look at this. See what I""ve found?"" Mikey held up some string that was hidden in the dust. He tugged at it, and then there was a sudden swish! from behind. Everyone looked wildly around and saw that Mikey had actually set off a chain reaction. ""Guys, freeze. Don""t move. Hey you guys! Back there! Don""t move a muscle!"" Then Mikey noticed that the boulders perched up at the ceiling were beginning to sway. ""RUN YOU GUYS, RUN!"" He yelled. They didn""t need telling twice. Everyone stumbled up, kicking up dust as they did so. Mikey, Brand, Mouth, Andy, and Stef ran ahead while Elle hobbled along. Halfway through, Mikey felt the familiar squeezing in his chest. His breath came out in a wheeze. He coughed, and Elle turned around. ""You okay?"" ""Okay."" He could barely get the words out. ""Use your inhaler!"" she urged him. ""Gave it- Mouth- to hold-"" he coughed. ""Good place for it. Mouth!"" she called. He turned around. ""What?"" ""I need Mikey""s inhaler, he""s coughing real bad..."" BOOM! the first boulder had dropped. ""Data?"" Elle called nervously. ""HOLY S-H-I-T-!"" he screamed back, flying down the hallway past Elle. Mouth reached into his pocket.",2855986
3323,"Wake up! YOU.ARE.A.MAN.NOT.A.WOMAN!"" Mito shook Yuta hard. Maya took out a handy video camera out of nowhere and started to record the scene. This will be very interesting...Yuta managed to get out of Mito""s grasp. His voice was full of fury as he spoke, ""Why can""t you understand me?!"" Everyone fell silent as they looked at Yuta with curiosity. Ooh.. what did Yuta mean by that?Sebastian sighed as he turned off the lights. He snapped his fingers and a spotlight appeared, it was focused on Yuta.Yuta dropped to his knees; tears were threatening to fall out of his gorgeous eyes.""Ooh! Don""t cry or your mascara will stain your beautiful cheeks,"" Luna threatened. Yuta shot her an intensified glare. ""Don""t disturb me! And my mascara is water-proof!"" he answered in a sarcastic tone. He then continued his speech. ""Why can""t you understand me?!"" he asked in a dramatic whisper, a faint sad melody filled the air- courtesy of Sebastian. Mito wiped her tears while the others yawned.This is B-O-R-I-N-G.""Can""t you accept that even if I am a man in built, I am a woman at heart?!"" he finished.Okay, we""re now again in the silent part.Silence... Ooh... silence Wee! Silence..... Still S-I-L-E-N-C-E I told you, we still have some silence... Okay, I""ll stop it before you""ll all kill me. Mito silently gasped. Her voice seemed to be depleted. Her mind echoed with only one thought:Yuta is gay not only in his sense of fashion but also (gulp) his heart...His brother admitted that he is a gay.Is this the end of the world? ""Waaaaaaah! I""ve lost my brother!"" Mito cried as she flung her arms around Mikami-sensei""s neck.Mikami-sensei blushed heavily as he patted Mito""s back. ""Don""t worry, we""ll find a way to bring good ol"" Yuta back,"" he assured. ""I""m in heaven!' he thought secretly. ""Maya, is there another way to bring Yuta back?"" Nina asked. Maya flinched by the use of her first name. ""Don""t call me by my first name since you""re not my friend!"" Maya spat. ""But she""ll be Yuta""s wife,"" Tsujiai suddenly muttered while Nina, who was beside him, giggled. Ooh! Will they play matchmaker on the two? ""Orihara, is there another way?"" Mikami-sensei asked again. Maya looked at him dully. She sighed. ""You didn""t read the label of the bottle, did you?"" she asked dully. Tsujiai got the bottle from his pocket. It was then that they realized that there is a postscript. It read: ""P.S. This product will only last for 3 hours. If you want a life-time effect, please go to our main office in Jusenkyo, China.'""Yuta! You""re saved!"" Mito suddenly shrieked in happiness as she hugged Yuta tightly. ""Wha-what are you talking about?! Who is Yuta?"" Yuta asked curiously. They all looked at him then at Maya. ""Why can""t Yuta remember anything?"" they chorused. Maya shook his head. These people are irritating. ""You haven""t finished reading the label,"" she simply answered. They all looked at the bottle again. There was another note. It read: ""P.S. #2 (is there such thing?!) We forget to mention that the person will have temporary amnesia while the product is in effect.",560480
3405,"Lina stared down at it, she stared for the longest time and thought about why she was doing this. The man she loved. She was leaving him. ""Ma""am, I have to be at a meeting in the next hour. Can we hurry this up?"" Roman""s lawyer snapped and Roman soon followed. ""Give the woman her fucking space, will ya?!"" His lawyer backed off and hers placed her hand on her shoulder, he was more sympathetic. ""If you need more time, then you can keep it until you sign, but until you sign he is still your husband."" She grabbed the pen, her hand shaking as she brought it down towards the paper. She dropped it before it could touch the thin white and sat back in the chair with a huff. ""It hurts."" She whispered. ""And I don""t know why."" ""Don""t be ridiculous. Let""s get this over with."" ""Shut up."" Roman demanded from his lawyer again, he was on the brink of puling his gun out and shooting him. ""I don""t think I am ever going to find someone like you."" ""I don""t think I will ever find someone like you."" ""Are you guys thinking about not going through with it?"" Her lawyer asked and before she could answer. ""No."" Roman said and her eyebrows furrowed with sorrow. ""You were just talking about-"" ""If you aren""t with me, I can""t hurt you again. Sign the papers angel face."" She gulped, standing back up and finally putting the pen down on the paper. Making her most elegant signature, Roman smiled to himself because she was more than just elegant. She was more than just a wife to him and now at the signature of a paper, she was no longer a wife not anything more physically to him then an x-lover. He stood up and circled around the table, a lawyer took the papers and put them in his suitcases to file at the courthouse. ""I am sorry that it had to happen like this. I love you."" ""I love you too."" He replied and held his arms open, she rushed into them, accepting the embrace. ""Sometimes it was really nice being your girl."" ""My gal... Always my gal."" The Liar With Lina""s skill set, beauty, and cunning it didn""t take long for her to find a job. But then again Roman had also referred her to a lot of others. She had settled down in an apartment not far from 52nd street where she use to live. She, however, never once visited that old Italian restaurant. She remained mostly to herself, only talking to someone when she needed something. She had no friends and when men tried to flirt with her, she would show them the ring on her finger without a word. It was hard those first few months, adapting to an empty bed, the sexual deprivation, and the silence. It wasn""t until the eighth month did she finally start to see a difference in it all. She missed Roman, but only the Roman that would hold her at night and watch movies with her, make love to her at random. This new sense of independence, however, was amazing to her. She could finally go somewhere without someone watching her nonstop, she could make her own decisions and spend the cash that she had worked hard for without someone breathing down her neck about it.",6234395
2010,"""Well you know... me, Donna, Kelly, David, and the newbies"" ""Newbies?"" Steve smiled, she was always full of questions... that was another thing he loved about her. ""Well there""s Matt who is Kelly""s boy toy"" Brenda cracked a smile, the first smile that wasn""t fake. ""Noah who was Donna""s boyfriend, there""s Janet my wife and there""s Gina... Dylan""s girlfriend"" Brenda""s smile faded when she heard the mention of Gina being Dylan""s girlfriend. She had no idea what so ever that she was his girlfriend. ""I don""t think that... Brenda stopped in the middle of her sentence when she saw Dylan come walking up. ""Yo D-man! How""s it hanging?"" ""Good"" Dylan eyes were fixed on Brenda, he looked up to see Steve staring at Brenda also. ""So what were you going to do with this beautiful young lassie? Hide her forever?"" Brenda smiled as Steve did his best Irish accent. ""No just for a couple of years"" Steve smiled and grabbed Brenda by the hand and pulled her up. ""So are we ready or what?"" ""Steve, I think I""m going to sit this one out"" Both Dylan and Steve stop chatting to stare at Brenda. ""Why not? Everybody is there and they will be so happy to see you. Come on."" ""Excuse me if I don""t want to go through the blinding pain of the long awaited reunion just so that I can see Kelly and see how much I""m not her"" Brenda bit down in her lip and yelled at herself in silence for her little comment. ""Maybe you""ve got it the wrong way. She""s not you, so Brenda get up and let""s go and prove that brunettes are the ones that have more fun"" Brenda smiled at Steve""s joke and got up. The car ride to the Peach Pit was the longest one she ever had. Beverly Hills was pretty much the same, still hot as ever and crowded as ever. She glanced at a store that her and Kelly used to go to all the time. She would casually stare at Steve and he would stick his tongue out at her or make a face as a lame attempt to make her laugh. ""We""re here madam and madam""s friend"" ""Thanks Jeeves"" Brenda sat there in silence looking down at the floor of the red corvette while Steve and Dylan talked. ""Let""s go Bren"" Brenda heard Dylan call her but she couldn""t fight back the fear and doubt in the back of her head. ""I can""t"" Her voice was faint but they both heard it, Dylan went to go talk to her but Steve stopped him. ""Let me"" Steve hopped back in the car and sat next to Brenda. ""So my young chickadee what""s on that little pretty brain of yours?"" ""I can""t go in there, I can""t face them"" ""You can""t face Donna, David and Kelly the people you spent the good ol"" days with? What are you so afraid of?"" ""That I don""t fit in here anymore. That I was gone so long that their lives don""t combine with mine anymore."" ""Okay Brenda you""re not making any sense at all. Sure you were gone a long time but there was not one time that we weren""t friends. So get your booty in that little diner that we all love so much and show us that you can always go home"" Steve hopped out of the car reaching his hand out to Brenda, she put her own in his and they walked to the Peach Pit. ""Don""t go in yet"" Brenda stopped and stared at Steve.",29783
439,"Only to find Mari rushing up the stairs, partially dragging the bewildered sous chef from Chloe""s room. ""Purr-incess-"" he began, his natural Chat Noir behavior kicking in. ""Move it, kitty. Akuma right behind us!"" she growled, shoving the chef in front of her. Chat frowned. Until a tidal wave of cheese geysered from the stairs, almost coating the trio. ""Whoa!"" Mari cried, ""Don""t let it touch you! You""ll get coated and won""t be able to move!"" He obediently heeded her words, ushering the duo through the doors into the floor he""d just vacated. ""Get back here, Lafayette!"" a voice snarled. ""What?"" ""It""s Colette- the girl Chloe fired. She""s been akuma-tized into the Chef Calamity. She""s taking revenge for being wrongfully fired!"" She shot a glance at their chef friend. ""Someone owes her an apology!"" Chat blinked as she made the chef look guilt-stricken. He""d never seen this side of his sweet little designing princess. He""d had maybe a peek working with her to cure the Evillustrator, but he didn""t think Adrien had had the pleasure... Maybe a glimpse back when Chloe tried to put down her great-uncle? He was intrigued. Suddenly, a cloud of spices started filling the hallway. Chat and his civilians paused to sniff. ""Is that..."" ""Cumin?"" the chef identified, before groaning. ""Oh no!"" Mari groaned. ""Run faster!"" Chat once again found himself running after his very bossy princess. The chef tripped over antray left in the hall and Mari paused to help him. ""Get up!"" she urged. A cloud of faint brown dust creeped up his leg. ""It""s too late for me, run!"" he told Mari. ""No, you have to- CHAT!?"" Chat hoisted his less-than-cooperative damsel in distress into his arms and rushed down the hall to an elevator. Dumping her inside, he ordered. ""Stay put until Ladybug and I handle the situation."" ""But-"" ""Please, princess..."" ""But I-"" ""Marinette if you""re going to make this difficult... CATACLYSM!"" The black aura of his special attack engulfed his hands and he pressed it lightly to the control panel. Immediately, sparks started flying and the door slid closed. ""CHAT NOI-"" She got cut off by the door. He ignored the banging. He stood back for a moment, pleased with himself. Worked out better than the last time he trapped someone in an elevator... Now, he thought, turning his attention back to the slowly filling hallway, back to his akuma-du-jour... Marinette banged her fist against the door of elevator, growling in frustration. ""Stupid Chat!"" Tikki flew from her hair, a convenient hiding place, given she""d dropped her bag running up the stairs. ""Marinette, we don""t have time for this! Chat;s out there fighting the unknown."" her partner reminded her. ""Not to mention he used Cataclysm just now."" That meant Chat only had about five minutes before he changed back. Mari sighed. ""You""re right. Tikki, SPOTS ON!"" The magic of the transformation sent a rush of tingles over Mari""s body. Her black-spotted costume raced over her normal clothes, turning ordinary Marinette into Ladybug the super heroine of Paris. In uniform, Ladybug inspected her options for getting out.",3439302
2994,"The tears that ran down Hisoka""s face pained his heart, even more so because he had to be the one to clean the thick mess Muraki lovingly left between Hisoka""s legs. Strong, embracing arms wrapped tightly around Hisoka""s body. Although he couldn""t stop his tears from showing, the older man never said a word about it. Gently petting his hair and kissing the area near his neck were all the ""words"" of comfort he really needed. As his head rested firmly against Tsuzuki""s chest, the sound of the rhythmic heart beat, the constant breaths that moved through that body was unbearable. It turned his body hot, and this time it wasn""t because of some drug. Hisoka didn""t need so say anything; Tsuzuki was reading his mind perfectly. Gentle kisses followed by the soft words, ""I love you,"" let Hisoka relax enough to at least try and sleep during the night. He inadvertently let out a yelp in surprise as Tsuzuki""s hand rubbed that hot, wanting area between his legs. Masterful hands made him moan, ""I""ll make you forget about Muraki tonight."" Tsuzuki said defiantly. He moved down to start licking the already wet cock. He made sure to kiss the branded area, sucking it, letting Hisoka know it would be okay. Tsuzuki really didn""t expect to do it this soon with his partner, but the boiled up anger that stemmed from Muraki waned into excited passion. He couldn""t help it now, he couldn""t stop this. ""I will make you forget."" ""I... love you,"" Hisoka replied softly. ""Only you."" Summary: Hisoka still doesn""t trust Tsuzuki, but when Muraki kidnaps him it seems that his partner is now his only salvation. A cursed tattoo, the red moon, and the magic rope made of witch hair that holds Hisoka""s life in the balance. ""Tatsumi, I know. It""s been three months but even if Hisoka""s body has recovered but he""s still not ready to go back to work. I refuse to let him go in this state!"" Out of the corner of his eye, Tsuzuki saw Hisoka twitch slightly in his sleep. He couldn""t help but exhale a sigh as he pressed on in the conversation, taking care this time to speak softer over the phone. ""You can do whatever you want to me later but I will not leave his side. I""m staying here and that""s final."" Tsuzuki could hear Tatsumi about to argue with him, but the phone remained silent. ""I""m sorry we can""t help you further, Tsuzuki. I really am."" Disappointment caught his body as he hung up the phone, the situation was starting to get to him causing a huge amount of undue stress. Every night the same things would happen over and over again, leaving Tsuzuki more than wondering just how much more of Hisoka""s outbursts he could take. The thing that annoyed him the most, was the fact that he was missing something crucial. There was something that Hisoka was hung up on, some memory or feeling he couldn""t get past and for the life of him, Tsuzuki couldn""t figure out what that ""moment"" was. He nearly jumped a mile in the air when he felt an unexpected pair of arms around his waist.",583994
1261,"""You told me something you liked. Do you like it?"" He was silent still looking her up and down as if she was a gift because to him she possibly was. ""I guess I will go put something-"" ""No."" He ground out in a sniveling manner as if he was a mad dog. His hands went up her hips and glided down her breasts. ""Oh yes... I love it. Remind me to fuck you in it when we are done working."" She turned beat red, slapping him playfully on the cheek. She didn""t expect that would turn him on more. ""Keep that up and I might not be able to wait."" He wove his fingers in through hers and tugged her to the door. ""Now come. Let""s go catch ourselves a Bat."" This Preview has been turned into a fiction works by the same name shown below and it is highly suggested you read this preview before starting it. A Shadows Heart (Preview) Being a member of the League Of Shadows was difficult, the ones who last are the ones who belong. She was the one that lasted, the one that survived through all of it""s hard ships. She didn""t bat an eye when Talia called to her, she didn""t bat an eye when her allegiance was tested by Bane, and she certainly didn""t bat an eye when Gotham was mentioned. She knew of its importance, it symbolized all the filthy that needed to leave this world. She was a first hand account of all that filth. Her and Talia had met when Raz""al Ghul saved her from her father, who had murdered her three sisters and her mother. It was Rhaz who had killed him and took her under his wing. That is where she had grown a close relationship with Talia, growing up alongside her and even when Talia considered leaving, she was with her. They were always like sisters, inseparable. She questioned Talia""s leadership at times, who wouldn""t after finding themselves sitting restless at the edge of the Gotham sewer system. Bane had found refuge here and as much as it annoyed her that while she was down here, while Talia was on the upper ground sleeping in a warm bed, she had to deal with it for Raz"" and Talia. So here she sat in the darkness, perched on the railing of a catwalk over a flowing river of sewer water. Her brown hair hanging down from the sides of her bruised face, wavy and wild. Blue eyes glittering in the little light that peeked in from above. Her olive skin glistening with a thin sheet of sweat. She wore a black tank top, tight fitting, a pair of tan cargo pants to follow up, and black boots. She was focused, eyes closed, knees brought up to the chest and elbows leaning on them. She hated the sickening smell that the sewer water gave off. She missed the sweet smelling springs of China, warm in the spring and summer. She would smile at that memory because there was very few memories that she had so peaceful, or calm. This moment was far from it, calm maybe, but peaceful, definitely not. She heard hurried footsteps clinking against the metal of the catwalk approaching very quickly, when they stopped not far from her. She rose a hand to silence the man, before he could say anything and aggravate her more.",6234395

About that time the Thing or as some people would call him Ben walked out. ""Oh Dawn that huge load over there is Ben,"" Dawn laughed as Ben yelled, ""Your going to regret that later flame boy."" Ben walked over and looked Dawn over and said to Johnny, "" You better not do anything to this one Johnny, she might kill you if you try."" Ben then looked back to Dawn and said, ""Hi my name is Ben I""m a friend on Johnny""s. His sister is in the kitchen cooking."" Dawn nodded at what he said and then the other""s led her to the kitchen where she saw a blond girl and well shaped as well working at the stove. The woman turned around and smiled at Dawn. ""Hi you must be that girl that Johnny talks about all the time,"" Dawn blushed at that. She couldn""t believe he told everyone about her. ""I guess so, my names Dawn,"" Dawn said. ""My name is Sue I""m Johnny""s sister. If you have any trouble you can call me and I""ll fix it,"" Sue said walking over and shaking her hand. ""Wait a minute your that one girl who tore up my car two weeks ago,"" Dawn said. ""Like I said I""ll fix anything. I think Reed knows how to fix that car back to its place,"" Sue said flashing Reed a look of concern. ""Yeah I""ll see that you get another car that looks and is built just like it,"" Reed said. ""Good,"" Dawn said smirking. ""Alright is everyone ready to eat,"" Sue said starting to place all the food on the table. Everyone said yeah. ""You know it""s nice to have another girl here, at least now we can control these guys,"" Sue said walking over to the table to sit down. Johnny being the charmer he was pulled the seat out for Dawn. Dawn blushed and said, ""Thank you Johnny."" ""Your welcome,"" Johnny said flashing one of his charming smiles as he sat down. ""So what""s for dinner sis,"" Johnny said. ""Lasagna, garlic bread, and salad,"" Sue said smiling. ""No I mean for desert,"" Johnny said smirking. Sue shot him a glare but answered with, ""Heard of a mini angel pie."" ""Oh I have they""re very good, my mother can fix the best chocolate one,"" Dawn said smiling at her. Sue smiled back and then both of them shot the others a gaze meaning what about you. ""Never heard of it,"" the boys said in unison. Sue sat down after all the food was placed. They said a prayer and began to eat while talking about various things like, cars, woman problems, men problems, Reed""s new invention, and last but not least how Dawn should be Johnny""s new girl friend which he agreed to quickly but Dawn just gave that look that meant no and then said it. After dinner Reed showed her his new invention, which was some kind of chip that you insert into someone""s skin and a remote that is on a watch that changes your appearance. He was still working on it but he thought it was coming along nicely.",806976
2645,"It""s as if my Doctor had suddenly split into two. For one moment I remember the old Doctor, the one I first met. The Ninth. I grew to love him even back then, but now I have difficulties to remember his face. Above all, I remember his kindness. But although he used to be ""my"" Doctor in the beginning, his successor assumed this position long ago. One of them - the old one, the real one - takes my hand and laces his fingers with mine. ""We did it, Rose Tyler,"" he whispers into my ear. ""And we were brilliant."" ""Yes, we were,"" I reply, leaning against him. And, remembering once again his old self, I add, ""we were fantastic!"" Growing Old With You Growing Old With You A rehash of the scene at Bad Wolf Bay in ""Journey""s End"" and a subsequent scene between Rose and DoctorDonna. First and only time in this series that a chapter is not told in first person perspective. I""ve messed up the dialogue a bit in the first part of this, as there""s no transcript out yet, but I""ve added a few bits and pieces of my own to explain things, anyway, so this is actually a rewrite - which doesn""t mean I didn""t like the original scene, it was perfect! Please let me know what you think, especially about this and the last chapter. His suggestion seemed preposterous to Rose. No matter how similar, the other Doctor still felt like a copy to her. And now he wanted to go off into the sunset once again and leave her behind with that copy. ""But you""re still the Doctor,"" she protested, feeling the tears well up in her eyes. ""I""m him,"" he said gingerly. ""I""ve got his mind, his memories, everything,"" the other Doctor added. ""I came from him."" ""Don""t you see what he""s trying to give you?"" Donna added. She looked at the other Doctor. ""Tell her!"" She turned around to look at the other Doctor. He looked exactly like the real one. He spoke like him, moved like him, thought like him. ""I""ve only got one heart now,"" he explained. ""I""m part human, and that""s changed some aspects of me - specifically, regeneration. I""ll grow old like you, and never regenerate."" He took a breath and looked at Rose. ""I""ve only got one life now - and I could spend it with you, if you want."" Rose fell silent. Then she lifted up her hand and placed it on his chest, feeling the beating of his heart soft under her palm. Just one heart, just like he""d said. The Doctor and Donna started to turn around, and Rose quickly turned. ""But it""s still not right!"" she protested. ""Rose, he is me,"" the Doctor reiterated, briefly touching her hand. ""He""s got my mind... he remembers everything we did together, everything that happened after you left... he""s got my quirks and my mannerisms - well, and he might have inherited one or two from Donna, sorry about that! - but what""s most important, he has a human heart. He has feelings I could never have. He can give you things I could never give you."" He was looking at her, a serious look in his eyes. ""And he needs you as I needed you when I first met you,"" he added. ""You can start anew, together, and it will make almost no difference for you."" ""But what about you?""",240213
2202,"Everything Jamie does, well he does it for you"" Tyler stared back at Catie for a few seconds before walking back into the school with a heavy look on his face. Jamie looked away from Val to see Tyler walking up to them. Jamie looked behind Tyler but his eyes found no trace of Catie behind him. ""Hey guys"" Tyler""s voice seemed tired and emotional, just like how he felt. Tyler ran his fingers through his hair and finally met Jamie""s eyes. Jamie""s eyes were pleading for an answer. ""I told her everything you told me, I mean everything Jamie"" Val looked over at Hank who had a still look on his face. He didn""t know how to really react. Everything about this situation made Hank sad and lost and he didn""t like that feeling. ""How did she take it? I mean, obviously she was upset, but how did she look?"" Tyler bit on his bottom lip and stared back at Val. ""She was more concerned with you lying to her. She seemed pretty upset about that, I thought she would follow me in here but she didn""t. So I don""t know"" Jamie shook his head. ""That""s all I needed to know, bye!"" Jamie took off running leaving a distraught Hank, Tyler and Val behind. ""Where are you going?"" Hank yelled after Jamie hoping he heard him. ""To Catie"" Jamie waved and flew through the doors and ran towards his bike. He hopped on without thinking twice about where he was going. He fastened his helmet on and sped off. Catie sat on the edge of a tall weepy tree. She had her knees drawn up to her chin and her arms were wrapped around her legs. Catie""s had her head resting on her knees and her hair was blowing in the wind. It was pretty cold outside but she didn""t really care, she just needed to be somewhere quiet. ""I thought I would find you here"" Catie didn""t dare to look up. She didn""t need to. She knew who it was, she knew it was Jamie; he was the only one who knew about her hiding spot. He was the one after all who had told her that they would need to find a secret hiding spot where they can go when things got too rough. ""Only you would since you are the only one that knows about this place, well you and the squirrels but I think they knew about the place before we did. The light brown one is a girl"" Jamie smirked and sat down next to Catie. ""What""s her name?"" ""Lisa. She""s a loner though. Her mom and dad don""t really pay that much attention to her and she doesn""t have a lot of friends. She has two real good friends though; they""re her best friends. She got into a bad accident two weeks ago, she was stabbed and one of her best friends lied to her about it and now she can""t trust anyone"" Jamie looked over at Catie. ""Maybe the one good friend that lied to her about it, never meant to hurt her. Maybe that was far from his list of intentions. Maybe he just wanted to protect her"" Catie shrugged. ""She can defend herself, she""s a tough girl"" Jamie scooted closer to Catie. ""He knows. Maybe he just wants to be part of her life because she is the coolest and best thing that happened to him.",29783
3627,"""So sweet tasting are your lips..."" Boromir spoke, his hand molding between her legs and making her gasp out a moan. Her hand clutching to his shoulder in response and head falling back into the pillows with her mouth agape and eyes shut tight. ""And your body."" His mouth covered all of her skin, from her neck to her supple breasts and eventually down her belly to where she grabbed his hair beneath the sheets and giggled sweetly. ""That tickles Boromir. What in gods name are you doing down there?"" ""Only searching."" ""For-"" He had found what he was looking for, lips engulfing that pleasure point and remaining there sucking until she was brought to her peak. Then to lighten her tensed up muscles, he tickled her again as he ascended back up to her lips. Beard covered with her nectar, she kissed him tongue first and nibbled at his cheek when her lips raveled around to his neck and she bit fiercely. ""Ow! What was that for?"" He exclaimed, she squealed when he pinched her bottom. ""Now everyone will know you are mine."" Her fingers traveled over his chest, where scars of all sorts resided. Fingers exploring down further until they stopped above his most sensitive region. ""Why- Why did you stop?"" He barely whispered, his breath catching. ""I am unsure."" She smirked devilishly. ""If I continue any further you won""t know who really is in charge."" He grinned with her, his free hand cupping at her dripping center and she moaned. ""I think we made that clear upon your first climax."" She bit her bottom lip and almost innocently moved her hands down further until she had grabbed him and he groaned his approval. ""It""s so short."" He froze, eyes shooting open to stare his hurt into her senses. She was smiling though and then he knew she was only joking. ""I was referring to the amount of time since you came into this room. If you thought I was talking about that..."" She tugged on him and he grunted. By now the two were sweating, naked, she had climaxed once, and had already had him in the palm of her hand. That was a very short amount of time. His hair was damp with sweat, strands sticking to his forehead same case for her. ""Then you are surely mistaken. In fact I could relate your thing to a horse""s thing."" Boromir burst out into laughter as did she and her head rested against his shoulder, his arm propped up on one side of her head, holding him up. ""Just say the word. It""s a penis darling."" ""I know what it is. I have never seen one before though, yours is the only one I have ever held also."" ""Well then I am grateful because then I can be both."" ""Both what?"" ""Your first and your last."" She released him as his lips meshed with hers again, the joking was over. It was time to be serious. She made this seem so easy, she knew it would hurt, but was so involved in him that it didn""t seem to matter. He hastily placed himself between her legs. Forearms on either side of her and he entered, she whimpered, his head leaning down to catch it with a kiss in which she moaned into.",6234395

We""ve seen the clip of you and Baymax a month ago during this ABC special, ""The Making of ""Frozen"""" and it""s so awesome and hilarious at the same time. Hiro: Yeah, as I looked at it, I was completely stoked, but then I was also embarrassed when I saw myself looking so weird when Baymax tried to check on me to see if there""s no injuries. But I""m really amazed at how many people want to see this movie. I""ve got about a million and a half likes on Facebook, multiple hastags on Twitter and Instagram. AniUniverse: And I see that ""Big Hero 6"" has flooded social media. Hiro: A lot of movies do that nowadays. And it""s just a way to bring in the latest updates on what""s happening with the movie; like contests, posters, trailers, TV spots, merchandises, movie stills and things like that leading up to the actual release for ""Big Hero 6"".

2578,"Imagine their shock after seeing the um... interesting scene. ""What.."" Mikami-sensei started. ""-The..."" Mito added. ""Heck...?"" Ayu finished. Tsujiai and Kaji had their jaws on the floor that they were utterly speechless. ""NINA?!"" Mito screeched. Still, no one paid them much attention. ""It seems we didn""t need to save her at all..."" Tsujiai said. The others nodded. ""What are we going to do now?"" Mikami-sensei asked. ""Watch."" Tsujiai answered as if it was the most practical way to do. ""Watch?! Are you crazy? Could we let that poor man be beaten by erm... Yami Nina?"" Mito retorted. (2) ""What can we do? We can""t interfere or we""ll be beaten like that."" Kaji said while shaking his head. ""Oh, and what""s with the ""Yami Nina""?"" ""I swear! That must be Nina""s Yami! The Nina I know can""t beat a person like that!"" Mito pointed Nina who was still beating the poor man. Without warning, the door opened with such force that it caught the audience""s attention. A lady wearing a black cloak walked inside. Behind her was a huge cauldron that about 3 persons could fit inside. Several servants pushed it. Acid green smoke emerged from it. Nina was still busy beating the man that she didn""t notice the situation. Kaji and Ayu quickly pulled Tsujiai, Mikami-sensei and Mito into the nearest curtain to hide. ""Ladies and gentlemen! You are very lucky to witness the making of a very rare potion!"" The lady announced. The people just kept silent. ""Isn""t that Luna?"" Tsujiai whispered. Ayu nodded. ""Then, why are we hiding?"" Mikami-sensei asked. ""Oh yeah, right."" Kaji scratched his head and they all emerged from their hiding place. ""This potion is called ""The summoning potion"". With this, you could summon the spirits of the dead."" Luna continued. The people""s eyes widened in fear. The potion was definitely in the black list. ""And it would be demonstrated by, none other than, Orihara Maya."" Luna finished. Silence ruled over them as Maya entered the room. Traces of hidden excitement could be found on her features. Tsujiai, Kaji, Mikami-sensei, Ayu and Mito gasped. If Maya is here, then Yuta must also be here. Mito""s eyes widened. She remembered what Luna said about Yuta being an ingredient in a potion. Could it be that... Yuta is already in that cauldron? She fainted. ""Mito-chan!"" Mikami-sensei caught her as she fell. Luna looked over at their direction. ""What can you say about this dream? Isn""t it nice?"" Luna asked. Maya looked at her disbelievingly. ""You mean..."" She started. Luna nodded. ""What do you mean?"" A voice interrupted them. It was the prince. Behind him were Rio and Tama. Luna immediately made her way to the prince and gave him a flower. ""I gave it to him!!!"" Luna squealed. The others sweat dropped. ""Anyway, what the heck happened here?"" Rio asked. He looked at Nina who was still beating the guy then at Maya who was standing in front of the cauldron. ""Why don""t we ask them?"" Tama pointed Luna and Maya. ""You see, I placed some potion on your goblets on dinner."" Luna explained. The people listened intently. ""That potion would allow us to meet in my dream.""",560480
1231,"Seventh, or was it eighth? He had lost count on how many times she repeated the same tune-Chopin""s etude no. 3. Sighing deeply, he pulled her upper arm to prevent her from crashing against the lamppost. The tune stopped and her eyes flew open. ""Oh, I- I""m sorry.."" Shaking his head, he continued walking, matching her pace. ""You,"" he coughed, willing himself to sound nonchalant, ""you seem absorbed on that tune."" ""Am I?"" she asked eagerly, her lips forming a beautiful (NOT beautiful, Len thought) smile. ""Your mother really taught me a lot of things, Tsukimori-kun. I""m so grateful."" ""She did?"" ""Yes!"" She laughed as she skipped ahead of him. Pausing, she faced him, her hand clasped together on her back while holding the blue violin case just as the light flickered on her face. ""I think.. I think I""m getting closer to your world, Tsukimori-kun."" Tsukimori""s breath caught on his throat as she smiled. ""I think I understand more and more about music, not just the notes but of what feelings they invoke. You""re really lucky, Tsukimori-kun, to be able to experience all of these from such a young age. Ah! Truly lucky!"" Tsukimori watched as Kahoko gazed at a distance. He really did not understand women. They are impulsive, unpredictable, and temperamental. But did they have this side to them as well? Contemplative? When Kahoko tilted her head and fixed her golden orbs on him, he felt as if she was seeing past him. ""Maybe-maybe someday I can enter your world, Tsukimori-kun. Little by little,"" she flashed a bright smile. Pivoting gracefully, she continued walking and she resumed humming. Had she really matured as a musician this much? Somehow, a warm feeling seeped into his heart, a feeling similar to the pride felt by a mentor as he watch his apprentice achieve greater things. ""I-I""ll be waiting for you,"" he said quietly but loud enough for Kahoko to hear. ""So.. don""t get too cocky. You still have a lot of learning to do,"" he paused before smiling-it was a small smile but was gentle. ""Hino Kahoko."" Seeping from her chest was a warm feeling that coursed through her veins, propagating throughout her whole being. He was finally treating her as an equal, worthy of being allowed to his world. She couldn""t help but feel the bubbling joy inside of her as she nodded, accepting his challenge. And Tsukimori Len felt content. The girl he had witnessed struggling with music was finally facing it head-on. The strength of her determination really astounded him. Her character, her passion in doing the thing she loves -they prompt him to strive harder. Everything about her always stirred something in him-was it his long forgotten passion to enjoy music? Whatever it was, he would always be watching her. To be Continued... The title of the song Hamai Misa mentioned is No Other Love. It is a lovely song, try listening to it some time. Yes, this story is romance but I just had to insert Tsukimori""s and Hino""s respect for each other as musicians.",560480
465,"Styling himself the Good Man, John Farson denounced Alucard and painted himself as the proponent of a new liberal vampire democracy. Despite not valuing freedom as defined by the Greco-Roman tradition, many vampires were more than welcome to the concept of democracy after a short hundred years of Alucard""s totalitarian tyranny. Farson however was hardly some good hearted democrat. Far from it, his habit of leaving the heads of his enemies on pikes was proof enough; the fact that he had repeatedly defied and decimated Alucard""s handpicked death squads was just icing on the cake. He was the only man on earth who could make sparkling look drop dead manly. John Farson and his ilk were Alucard""s problem, not Seras""s. She didn""t care what the good man did to Alucard; she just wanted to stay alive. Currently, Lord Alucard was getting dolled up for his public appearance and Seras needed to get the final paperwork in. What was planned was a combination of a Nazi rally and a rock concert. Alucard was utterly devoid of empathy. He was more than just another sadist playing the role handed to him by circumstance; he was a predator who had neither peers nor friends. If the entire vampire nation had one throat, he would happily cut it just to show off his own power. As Seras walked down the brightly lit hallway, she failed to hear the sound of werewolf""s feet behind her. A powerful force knocked Seras from behind, throwing her forward and slamming her head into a wall. The impact tore her skull open and blood flowed into her eyes. Through her blood clouded vision, Seras could almost make out the brutal hand of Canker Canison reaching out for her. Digging his claw like fingernails into Seras""s face, Canison laughed at the puny vampire""s attempt at escape. Her strength was no match for that of the inbred werewolf and he threw her aside callously. If the Captain was one side of the werewolf coin, then Canker Canison was the other. Seras""s eyesight cleared up just in time for her so see Canker bearing down on her like a blood mad dog. His fox like hair was wild and greasy and his long tongue hung out as he panted crazily. His massive paw of a hand thrust out and grabbed Seras by the face. She tried to bite him, but her delicate fangs could hardly make a scratch on the scarred and calloused skin of canker""s paw. Seras nearly choked; the stink of Canker Canison was tremendous; like an unwashed beast bathed in blood. To her everlasting horror, he ripped open her shirt and bra with one stroke; the cold air suddenly felt cold on her exposed breast. Meanwhile, Canker""s skinny dog like legs pushed forward, thrusting his slobbering mouth full of yellowed teeth right into Seras lips. As kisses go it was the most violent that Seras had ever had. Canker""s teeth were sharp in both human and wolf form; they cut her lips and tongue and prevented any effort on her part to scream. Her world went white when he pulled away from the kiss and threw a punch at her face. The force of the blow was so great that one of Seras""s eyes popped out and rolled on the floor.",1220273
33,"""Hey..."" he choked out. She wiggled her fingers in that weird salute giggly girls at his old prep school (he got kicked out of three months after enrolling) used to do as he walked by. A rosy blush was on her cheeks as she hovered outside his window. ""Can I come in?"" ""What do I get in return?"" he replied. He was a certified M. He was dying to let her in and ravish her lips until he could salvage his image in her eyes. He was supposed to be the bad boy. ""A kiss..."" she answered, rather low. Good thing he""d been listening so intently for her reply, or he""d have never rocketed the three yard distance from his bed to the window in 0.78 seconds flat. He let her in and received a kiss... on the cheek. ""Tease."" Brick muttered following close behind her. ""I never said where."" Bloss pointed out, her face reddening. She sat on his bed, a pink petal in a storm of blood red. Her face seemed to redden even more. ""I came to tell you about the report I got from Professor; you said you wanted to hear about it."" He nodded and took a seat behind her, pulling her into the nest he made with his legs. ""So, what does the report say, Sakura?"" She stiffened in his arms. He must have hit a nerve. ""What? Rio, boy wonder, calls you that. Can""t I?"" ""It""s just a pet name. When I started learning Japanese, Rio was with me. The teacher gave us all new names for a week, and made us learn to write them in romanji. Sakura kind of stuck, so he calls me that. It""s nothing."" Brick rolled his eyes. ""Right... Like he wouldn""t have a secret crush on you..."" He""d spoken to the guy, and wanted to knock out his teeth; he guy had nothing but glowing, adoring comments on Bloss. And Rio the magnificent had all but said he didn""t like her dating Brick-and even mention that her last boyfriend had been an honor student who had previously studied in Germany or something, Dexter or Baxter... ""He""s just overprotective... He had a little sister once. She... she disappeared."" Brick felt more sympathy for the red-headed enforcer than he""d like, and sobered up. ""Oh..."" A.K. : That was a brief look into Rio""s past. I guess it""s time to reveal that the Hamilton boys are all adopted. Rio was picked off of a poor family and used in illegal experiments by that government-I can""t tell you the name-along with Robbie and Ricky. America intervened, and the boys were set to be terminated, but Dr. Hamilton stepped in and told them otherwise. More about Rio""s life will be revealed in Ion""s crossover with- Oops, said too much. Also, Luna did unintentionally cause Blossom""s sickness; more in the next chapter. Please keep reviewing. A.K. : Fresh from camp and still writing. Comment: Worst experience I""ve ever had there! I would have had more fun watching paint dry, or reorganizing lint! For my sanity and yours I will not retell. I""ll just type. Plus side to all this: Carl got so scared from camp; he""s become a hermit in his own house! Chapter 14 Luna prowled the alley in the daylight, eyes scanning for a sign of white fur. Suddenly, a chill rolled down her spine.",3439302
528,"she argued hotly, but Sebastian cut her off. ""Christ Almighty, you""re as stubborn as a mule! It""s no wonder the English couldn""t stand you! I said, go!"" he roared the last word with the lung capacity of a mountain lion, along with a little shove pushing her in the way she""d come. And she ran. She felt beyond insulted. In fact, when she tried to think of a word to describe how disgusted she felt, none came to mind. His words echoed in her ears as she ran through the thick foliage, pushing branches out of her face. You""re as stubborn as a mule! It""s no wonder the English couldn""t stand you! She was crying. She wasn""t sure if it was from the boy""s words or from the branches that kept slapping her face. She""d been stupid to think him a friend. Perhaps everything he""d said to her before had been a trick, an illusion to get him on her good side. Perhaps all he had ever wanted to do was bed her, and move on to the next vulnerable wretch to stumble into the court. The trees were thinning out now. She could see exactly where the forest ended and where the field began, and she launched herself into the tall grasses that guarded the nearby pond. Over her pants and gasps for breath she could hear a dog barking, and not long after, a woman""s voice. ""Sterling! Sterling, get back here!"" The dog, Sterling, was now snarling at her. It was a great ugly brute, its fangs bared in a growl as Lyanna neared the stranger. She was sitting near the pond""s shores, holding pebbles in her hand; with a start Lyanna realized it was Mary. ""Sterling!"" Mary commanded again. ""Sit! There""s a good boy."" She turned to Lyanna with a smile. ""I""m afraid you will have to excuse Sterling. He barks at everything. Why, just earlier, he was barking at the forest."" She patted the dirt next to her. ""Please, sit with me. It is lonely here."" Lyanna, too out of breath to protest, obeyed. ""What""s your name? I know you know who I am; I saw you when I arrived."" ""Lyanna. Lyanna Davenshaw."" ""Oh, you are the English ward. Correct?"" Lyanna nodded. ""Are you enjoying French court life?"" ""It""s alright. Your Grace,"" she added hastily. ""I suppose it took a long time to adjust,"" Mary smiled as she held another pebble to the sunlight. ""Do you think Francis will like this?"" Lyanna blinked. ""What, the pebble?"" ""Yes. You know, he makes and decorates swords sometimes. A hobby, of course. I wanted to give him these, just to help. So do you think he will like this one?"" Lyanna looked at the stone. It was light brown, with flecks of darker brown. ""It""s very nice, Your Grace."" ""I thought so,"" Mary agreed, adding the pebble to the small collection in her palm. ""You and I are very much alike, Lyanna. I would like us to be friends."" ""A-alike, Your Grace?"" Mary waved a dismissive hand. ""You do not have to call me that. Among friends, there are no titles."" She smiled again. ""We are both strangers in a foreign land, are we not? Friends are hard to come by here."" ""I suppose so, yes."" They were quiet for moment. ""Your Gr- Mary?"" ""Hmm?"" she asked as she held another pebble in the sunlight.",2855986
2439,"""The quintessential man eater and her hapless prey."" ""Oh,"" Nanako said, and turned around to set the tray down where the dishwasher could easily collect it. Surprisingly, she didn""t add anything else. Meiko looked at her senpai, wondering if she was missing something. ""Spit it out,"" she said after a long moment, deciding a direct approach was best. ""It""s nothing, hon,"" Nanako demurred. ""Don""t you have an order to get to the chef?"" Meiko gasped slightly, a hand reflexively covering her mouth. ""I almost forgot!"" she exclaimed in horror, the lack of attention to her work flustering her tremendously. The chef cheerfully agreed to match the bottle of red zinfandel the bartender had provided. He liked couples that let him experiment with the menu, because the bistro attracted far too few adventurous types for his liking. Most diners preferred to stick with ""tried and true"" meals. She returned a couple minutes later, ready to serve the wine, and hoping that her tardiness hadn""t been noticed. She showed both of them the label, and the woman nodded with approval. ""That should be fine,"" she said, smiling as she stroked the hand of her dinner companion. Meiko cut the casing and removed the cork, pouring out a couple tablespoons worth of the valuable liquor (which retailed for around 40,000 yen a bottle). The woman took it from her gracefully, holding the glass up to the light to inspect the color as she swirled it to check the wine""s legs. A smile curved her (red, red) lips as she held it under her nose to smell the bouquet. Then she took a sip, letting the wine linger on her tongue before swallowing. ""Very good,"" she said, before indicating Meiko should finish pouring the wine. Meiko finished pouring, unable to avoid noticing the smooth elegance of the woman as she raised her glass again. After setting the bottle on the table, she went to fetch the hors d""oeuvres. Chef had outdone himself, she thought as she saw the lobster bisque he had whipped up, served in tiny demitasse cups with spoons garnished with dollops of crème fraîche. It was a bit unconventional, but this couple seemed the type to appreciate it (or the woman would, and anyone looking at the two could tell who had control in that relationship). She made her way back through the restaurant, noticing how the woman was actually leaning against the man""s arm. His eyes were fastened on his date""s face, which made Meiko pause for a bit. With the outfit the woman was wearing, most men would be focused on her chest. Especially considering the casual contact the woman kept indulging in. It was a slight note of discord to the image of ""vamp and victim"" Meiko had mentally formed of the couple. The woman smiled and thanked her as she set the food down, before picking up the spoon and taking a small bite of the spicy bisque. ""This is wonderful,"" she said, a blissful smile on her face. ""Please pass my compliments to the chef."" Despite her expectations, the couple proved to be remarkably easy to serve.",1112924
309,"Her body shivering wildly, Yuuki said a few quiet words under her breath. ""Too strong...perhaps the spirits here were too strong for you, Switch-kun..."" The staring had lasted for quite awhile, and it had become quite unsettling, even for someone like Switch. After a good five minutes, the normally uncaring Himeko couldn""t help but notice that the otaku of the Sket Dan wasn""t making any effort to even pretend like he do anything on his laptop. Switch had just been aimlessly staring at the computer""s screen the whole time. ""Hey!"" Himeko called out in an annoyed tone, which managed to wake up Bossun from his nap. Switch gave her no response. Gritting her teeth, Himeko called out again, louder this time. ""Didja hear me? Hey! Say something! Your weirdness is really starting to creep me out over here!"" she exclaimed, but he still remained silent. Now sitting up and awake, Bossun looked over at Switch, quickly noticing the lack of energy in him as well. For a moment, he thought Switch""s fingers were reaching for the keys in front of him, only to pull back at the last second. Bossun couldn""t watch his friend like this. So when the leader of the Sket Dan looked over Switch""s shoulder, he could see that the otaku was just staring at what was left of his desktop wallpaper. The same Futari Wa Nervous! Wallpaper from before was still blurred with bloody marks, and the timer signifying the presence of the Midnight Curse was still counting down. Squinting, Bossun could see that there was only one interval left on the timer. Twelve hours remained until the last stroke of midnight. ""I""m going to make a wild guess and say that you""re still having some trouble with the whole virus business..."" Bossun commented. Quick typing from Switch""s fingers came in response. His voice, however, was much less audible than usual. His voice synthesizer sounded like it was practically whispering. [There are errors in my system now that I fear may be irreversible. This virus is proving to be something that I did not expect.] ""Sounds like it""s really screwing up with your voice too."" Bossun said in a sympathetic tone. He put a hand on Switch""s shoulder and gave him a reassuring smile. ""I think you can get through this though. I know you, Switch. You""re not one to give up so easily."" Himeko made a loud slurp, before pulling the Pellolipop out of her mouth. ""Maybe this is a sign, leader. Maybe I was right for once! It""s probably a real curse. If all of Switch""s research on the occult didn""t work, then he""s only got one option left."" ""And what might that be? Assuming this really is some sort of crazy mystical curse..."" Bossun asked, and in response, Himeko just made a grimace, as if she really didn""t want to say her next few words. ""At this point, he""d have to go directly to Yuuki-san for help. If she""s the cause of this Midnight Curse, then she""s probably the only one who can reverse it."" Bossun looked down at Switch. There was an uneasy look in the leader""s eyes as he contemplated the options in front of his friend.",967934
3394,"She chose everything for herself, and had her own way of life. She lived without shame or fear. Miyazawa... It was totally unlike my usual self- just her profile at that moment, how it left an impression. I wanted to know her. I watched her leave, after giving me a graceful wave. I stood for a second, before leaning against the desk. I needed the support to collect myself. The last week I had found myself fascinated by her, but... today... I had realized it. I wanted to know what she was thinking. I wanted to ask her about various things. Did she ever have worries or uncertainties, too? Did she feel like she was carrying isolation? I wanted to know... ...more. And more. The next day I opened my shoebox to find one of those dreaded love letters. I hated receiving them, for unlike Miyazawa, I couldn""t deal with them gracefully. All I could do was turn them down, and try to make the lame excuse that I wanted to focus on my studies or something. There was ice within my soul, ice that no ordinary girl could melt. Their feelings of adoration couldn""t reach mine, and while I knew I should feel horrid for breaking their hearts, all I felt was empty. There was an isolation around me, as always. I took the letter out, noting the familiar hearts on it. It asked for me to meet them after school, by the row of cherry trees. I resented that. I had come to think of the cherry trees as my special place, my place of peace in school. It was an intrusion. Still, I put the letter into my book bag, as Miyazawa had done to her own a few days before, and pushed it to the back of my mind. Classes went as usual, and all too soon, the final bell rang, letting me know that I had a meeting to attend. I waved off the usual invitations to join my classmates in their after school pursuits, and headed for the sakura grove. I wasn""t particularly concerned by who had invited me. I didn""t really care. All I was thinking was what excuse I should use this time. Schoolwork? Kendo? Student Council? I saw a girl""s silhouette leaning against a tree, and this was when I made my first mistake. ""Um..."" I said, trying to get her attention. She spun around, startled. It was like a scene from a dream. The flower petals fell around us, and their sweet perfume filled the air, making me feel alive with their heady fragrance. The light pink of their blossoms brought out the startled blush of the girl""s cheeks, and the girl""s wide eyes transfixed me. One thought hit me like a ten-ton weight: Miyazawa-san likes me?! Joy flowed through me, genuine, unadulterated joy. It was something I had not known before, and it was a feeling I wished I could grab and hold onto forever. A deep flush worked its way onto my face. I had been preparing to reject the girl""s feelings, but I didn""t want to reject Miyazawa. I started to stammer, but was interrupted. ""Excuse me,"" a quiet voice said from behind, and I spun around, to face another of my insipid admirers. ""I""m sorry for making you wait."" Miyazawa seemed to come to life, and the moment was broken. ""Oh, were you meeting someone?"" she asked.",1112924
2606,"""My dear, are going to be my... What""s it called..."" He brought the blade up to his lips and tapped it thoughtfully there, his mind off looking for a proper name. ""Groupie."" He blurted out when the answer was clear, a present smile on his face, the blade was back at her wrist. Her mouth dropping open and her teeth grinding at the fate waiting on her, his cut would make her insane. ""Like all those celebrities have Groupies, I will only need you. You will be my Harley. We can have so much fun together."" ""Why?"" ""I""m sure Batman doesn""t go around looking for sidekicks and beautoful broads to throw over his shoulder. This way I will have you, I will have something..."" He leaned downward, elbows on his knees, the knife slowly began to cut. Her breath hitches and she let out a heated moan. ""Violent."" He ground out in a animalistic tone. She moaned his name when the blade carved deeper into her skin. He chuckled, removing the blade, he threw it to the side and bringing his mouth to lick up the blood dripping down her wrist. When it was gone, but kept profusely running from the fresh wound, he licked his lips looking up at her. ""Yes. I""ll do it."" She only said yes, because she wanted to help him. She had shot someone before so that wouldn""t be hard, but keeping his attention would, staying alive would deem difficult. ""Perfect. Now go get dressed in something you think I""ll like and bandage up that wrist."" She stood and left the living room doing as he instructed, she didn""t really have anything he""d be interested in. She bandaged up her wrist, going though her closet afterwards, she found something. It was originally something her friend got for her so she could show off to her boyfriend. It was pretty much stripper wear, but it was her favorite colors red and black. A bright red ballerina like skirt that was poofy at the ends. Long fishnet black stockings that went down into leather boot heels that zipped up to below her knees. Black Lace went down the sleeves from the red sports bra that fit very tight to her breasts and showed off her flat stomach. Fingerless black gloves, she put her hair up into pony tails and to appease the Joker. She put white makeup on her face, black around the eyes to make it like a mask, and beat red lipstick. She stepped over to the door and exited the room taking a deep breath and hoping he would enjoy it. When she exited, his back was to her, he was wearing his coat again and scavenging through the fridge. She made a fake cough, placing her hands on her hips and smiling brightly in his direction. He turns to her, freezing he dropped the plate he had held in his hands, it fell to the ground breaking into pieces. She smirked since he wasn""t particularly a man to surprise easily. She leaned into the wall of the hallway and seductively winked at him. ""Fuck me..."" He said under his breath, stepping slowly over to her, looking her up and down. ""Look at you."" He growled lowly, arousal in his tone, lust in his eyes. ""When I told you to get ready I wasn""t expecting this. No wonder you took so long.""",6234395
495,"""Now where""d you get that idea?"" Mitsuru laughed under his breath, smiling down at me, ""He absolutely adores you. You should""ve heard him go on about you when you graduated to SeeD on your first try!"" ""A-are we talking about the s-same man?"" Curse my stuttering... ""The headmaster of Balamb Garden, Alphonse Kramer, right?"" I nodded slightly and he smiled again, ""See? Sure, he may seem cold to you, but that""s only politics. He doesn""t want it to seem like he""s favoring you at all; but when it""s just him, me, and the other SeeD captains, you""re all he""ll talk about. Serious granddaughter complex, if you ask me."" ""Really?"" He laughed louder this time and I couldn""t help but giggle a bit myself. It was like his mirth was infectious; no wonder he was our leader, ""Yeah, that man""s crazy when he can actually be himself. But enough about Al, I want to know about you. Al and Heather have told me all about you."" ""H-Heather?"" I asked, puzzled. So he did know her, ""How do you know Heather?"" ""She""s the Sorceress-in-Training, remember?"" Mitsuru said as if I was missing something important. When I sat there, blinking stupidly, he sighed, ""I""m the SeeD Commander, she""s the next Sorceress. Get it yet?"" Then it hit me; of course they knew each other. A Sorceress always needs her knight to keep her sane. A knight to stand by her and protect her sanity so she won""t become Ultimecia. The position of knight customarily goes to the SeeD Leader. ""So... you""re is to be Heather""s Knight..."" I said slowly, looking down at the few little flowers. ""Yeah..."" Did he sound somehow... regretful? I looked up at him, tilting my head to the side slightly. Shouldn""t he be happy to be the Knight? He would have an easy life then, together with his Sorceress. ""You know... if it was my choice, I wouldn""t be the leader at all."" ""What?"" My eyes widened and I quickly swung around, making sure no one was around to hear what he just said. The SeeD Leader doesn""t want to be the leader? But Mitsuru was a great leader... we haven""t lost a single SeeD since he was in charge. And he would be the Sorceress""s Knight, the greatest position next to the SeeD Leader. He would be both, and was a Leonhart to boot! The Leonharts... the blood of the great heroes Squall and Rinoa run through his veins... why wouldn""t he want this? Mitsuru""s smile began to grow a sad edge, ""I don""t want to be the leader. All the pressure... all the bullshit politics, all this predestined, ""Fated Children"" crap... it""s not what I want."" He sighed and laid back in the grass, staring up at the cloudless sky, ""I don""t know why I""m telling you this. Maybe it""s because I feel like I already know you so well from Heather and Headmaster Alphonse. They both know how I feel about the whole thing. I just want to be free, but this name... Leonhart, it traps me. Traps me in a cage where all the important decisions about my life are made for me. You ever feel like that?"" I shook my head. Honestly, I though it would be great to be in his position. To be the leader of such a noble, powerful, amazing group such as SeeD, ""I don""t get it.""",748687
2947,"And we are all here for you, so don""t hesitate if you want someone to talk to."" ""Thank you."" -------------------------------- ""Tasuki!"" Mitsukake called. ""What do you want?!"" Tasuki snapped. He was sitting on a branch of a tree. ""Why don""t you go and meet Chidori? She is a nice girl."" ""Why do you all like her? What if she is a spy sent by Seiryuu?"" ""I don""t think so."" ""Aw, come on! Things like that could happen."" ""Tasuki!"" Nuriko came out of the kitchen followed by Chidori. Tasuki immediately jumped off the branch and walked away. ""She is not a spy!"" Nuriko shouted at the retreating figure of Tasuki. ""Such a brat,"" Mitsukake walked inside the house. Nuriko just stayed where she was. ""Nuriko, why does he think I am a spy?"" Chidori asked. They both sat down under the tree. ""You see, Chidori, we are running a restaurant."" Nuriko pointed the sign on the front door that read ""Suzaku Restaurant"". ""And what is Seiryuu?"" ""It is the restaurant a couple of blocks away from here. It is also our major competitor. Our restaurant has been doing good, unlike theirs so you know..."" ""Tasuki thought that maybe I am a spy from Seiryuu that would like to see your recipes."" ""Somewhat like that."" ""But...I am not."" ""You are not, honey. Well anyway, let""s get back to work. Could you help me do the laundry?"" ""Of course."" ------------------------------- In another part of town, a young man was finding his way through the early morning crowd. ""Chidori, I""ll find you no matter what."" --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------To be continued...So what do you think? Please Review!!! Okay, Nuriko here is not a boy! I repeat. Nuriko is NOT a boy! She is a girl. The Fushigi Yuugi characters don""t have their powers and are working in their restaurant. Chiriko is Hotohori""s younger brother only in this fic. The reason why I made this somewhat a crossover is that I can""t find the right people that will shelter Chidori while she is ""away"". Having original characters will just make you confuse. (Since I really can""t describe a person that much.) With the Fushigi Yuugi cast, you have a background about them. They also possess the characteristics I need for this fic. Konichiwa! Thank you for all your reviews. You really inspired me to write this chapter.Disclaimer: Ayashi no Ceres and Fushigi Yuugi are properties of Yuu Watase.Chapter 4 Meeting you again ""It has been a week..."" Aya sat beside Suzumi who sat quietly in the kitchen. Suzumi looked at her and tried to smile. ""Aya! You must be resting in your bed. You are scheduled to give birth this week, right? You must be prepared. You must have a lot of energy."" ""It has been a week..."" Aya repeated again. Suzumi""s expression darkened, ""Aya, she will come back. Don""t worry..."" ""But...it""s all my fault...if I only..."" Aya found herself unable to continue. ""She will come back. Now, worry about your child first. Chidori would like to see her when she comes back, right?"" Aya nodded and proceeded to her room. When Aya was gone, Suzumi sat quietly again.",560480
263,"The next morning, after they burned Sonoa""s body, and put her ashes in an urn, to be buried in the village of her birth, Shako stood on the steps of the Shrine in front of Kikyo and Keade. He bowed, and gave Kikyo a necklace; a chain of white prayer beads attached to a lavender crystal. ""This I give into your keeping,"" Shako said to the young woman before him. ""To keep pure and holy...to protect. The Shikon no Tama."" Kikyo said no words. She took the Jewel, and concentrated. When she looked at her hand, it seemed like any crystal...but she knew its price. She and her sister watched Shako descend the stairs, and lead his warriors away from their village. AN: I know from the show that it was Songo""s grandfather that gave the Sacred Jewel to Kikyo, but they never said how he knew about her. So I made him Sonoa""s (my OC) older brother. P.S. Thanks to Eien for correctining the name of Songo""s grandfather. I have done my best to go through here and correct it. Ch. 4 A Heavy Burden They started coming almost immediately. The night after the slayers had gone, the first of the monsters had tried to sneak into Kikyo""s own room. It was a serpent that tried to strangle her as she slept. But her sixth sense had awakened her in time to grab her dagger and stab it. It tried to slither away, but he took an arrow from her quiver and stabbed it again, slicing it in two. She never wore the Jewel after that. The following morning, she spoke with the elder monk, and they had a special shrine bult to house the Jewel, a stand in the center of the room held the Jewel, and many of the archer priests surrounded the building. And Kikyo moved her meager belongings to rooms that were much closer to the miniature shrine, that she might also guard it closely. When she was not guarding the Jewel""s shrine, she was going about the village, patrolling the boarders of the village or attending the sick and injured. As she walked about, many who she had known would stare. Men mostly, for they found her desirable. More men, young and old, came seeking her favor during that first year of protecting the Jewel. Most nobles and warriors only did so to try and take the Jewel, but she was too intelligent to fall for their hollow flattery. They cared not for her...only the Shikon no Tama...and they felt not love, but lust. The women of the village, however, were somewhat divided. Some remembered her as the kind, sweet Kikyo they had known or that they remembered with her mother and father, who were kind and respectable people. Other women envied her, saying she was too beautiful, and spread rumors about her that she was a witch and used spells to make herself beautiful, that she hungered for men and that was why she lived in the shrine with so many of them, that she herself wanted the Jewel to use it for her own purposes. And others still simply feared her and never spoke to her. Then, there were the children. The children alone were not afraid of her. They did not run when she drew near, nor did they say hurtful things about her.",512464

I know that Yves has been (and probably will be) out of character throughout this story, and I sincerely apologize for that. But if I change anything, then this story will REALLY make no sense whatsoever. After all, I just wrote it to figure out my own situation... I am confused. I am deeply confused, and that is a rare thing. Usually I can handle each and every situation, no matter how tricky. But this time it""s different. Because it""s about Jimmy. Jimmy, Jimmy, and always Jimmy. He is the only man who can make me feel like an eighteen-year-old again. He makes me fall back into this old pattern of flirting, trying, playing, and retreating. I used to be a straightforward person. I used to say honestly whatever was on my mind. Why can""t I this time? People often say I am a beautiful woman. And therefore they expect me to behave like one. They see me and think, ""I""m sure she""s having boys at her fingertips.""",240213
2379,"Orson asked. ""Then why didn""t you say so? If it""s an offering, then we should have given them fresh meat instead of a stupid song. Maybe they""ll take you?"" he sneered at Leaf. She had no qualms about hitting once more. Or maybe ten. ""The forest is pleased,"" Magnus said, putting his instrument away. ""They""ll let us pass safely. They recognize that my fiddle was made from one of their fallen brethren, and that my music honors his memory."" The group of adventurers entered the green kingdom, the path sun dappled. They walked on for several miles before a voice ahead of them cried, ""Halt! Who dares enter our realm?"" ""Magnus, son of Sir Parn,"" Magnus answered. ""I am Leaf of Flaim."" Leaf said. Suddenly, Elves leaped from the trees and shrubs, surrounding them on all sides. A captain of the Green, an Elf with long yellow hair, eyes like emeralds, and age beyond reckoning, came fourth. ""All Elf kind are welcome here,"" the captain said, ""Even our distant cousins, the Grass Sprites."" ""Al right!"" Maar cheered. ""But what of these Men, and this Dwarf?"" he asked. ""They are my companions,"" Magnus answered. ""They""re Elf friends."" ""Then they""re welcome as well."" he said. ""Come brother, sister, let us go to the great hall, eat, drink and be merry."" The captain led them off the trodden path, and into the deep green of the forest. ""I thought Elf realms were bright,"" Ryna said as she pushed back tree branches. ""Most Elf lands are, but some prefer to keep their realms green and lush, even to the point of over growth. It""s one of their defense mechanisms. This way, we of the green know the instant an intruder has entered."" Magnus said. ""How do you know so much?"" Gerrek asked. ""These are my people,"" he said. ""This is the home of my people. This is my grandfather""s domain. The High Elf Lords have blessed this place."" ""Your grandfather!"" Leaf exclaimed. ""This is Deedlit""s home?"" The captain turned and said, ""Deedlit is my sister."" ""You mean your fellow Elf?"" Greebus asked. ""No, my blood relation,"" the captain said. ""We have the same father. My name is Deedling."" ""Then Magnus is your nephew?"" Elska asked. ""He is, and all Elven kind are our brothers and sisters."" said Deedling ""This is one crazy family,"" Maar said. ""Don""t be so quick to judge, little cousin,"" Deedling told him with a smile. They journeyed farther an farther into the wood, until they came upon a sight few had ever seen. A castle made from living trees.. Their trunks and limbs intertwined into a fortress. Through small breaks in the bark, where the trees had failed to touch, or grow flowers, lights twinkled, giving hints of the activity within. The company and their escorts went across the bridge, and through the opening briar-rose doors. They stood on the threshold of a great green hall, at the far side of which sat a great Elf Lord. His crown was decked with jewels that sparkled like stars plucked form the sky, and his long white hair hung down like a cape about his shoulders and back. And his robe was as dark a green as the grass growing beneath his feet. ""Welcome guests,"" his great, deepened voice said.",512464
1459,"I""m starting to feel too crowed,"" John said as he gently grabbed her hand again and began leading her through the crowd to the exit. Andy took one last look back at her cousin who lifted his head to watch her leave. He must of saw that glimmer of guilt because his face softened. She shouldn""t have shown him that, but she felt that he should know. He should know that she could never hate him. John might be who she was in love with, but Bobby meant more to her. Bobby was her blood cousin and the one who had been with her for years. Family came before anything else, even John. Andy reached out to Xavier and instantly received him. ""I hear you Andy,"" Xavier said through her mind ""I want stay with them for long Xavier. I""m only doing this for the child""s sake and his father""s sake. Let Bobby know I still care for him,"" Andy said. ""I will Andy. Always know you""ll have a place at my school, you, your child, and John,"" Xavier said. ""Thank you. I""ll be back there as soon as I can,"" Andy said and then finished, ""I""m on everyone""s side. Not just theirs."" ""I know,"" Xavier said and that""s where Andy broke their connection as John dragged her into the elevator. ""If I had known they were going to be here I would have never brought you,"" John said thinking that might comfort her. ""No, it""s alright John. I think it was a good thing to see them. I think they know now which side I""m on,"" Andy said as she pushed the button for the garage floor. John smiled and pulled her closer and kissed her again. Andy this time fell back into her own little world and kissed him back. She loved how his lips felt on hers and the way his touch was warm and comforting. She didn""t know how any woman would not want him. That might be her downfall someday though. Her feelings were too strong toward him and she never let her emotions ever take control of her. She was setting herself up again for hurt like she had with her parents. She couldn""t let it happen again, but yet as she felt him pull her closer; she knew she couldn""t block it. She was falling for him and it was slowly killing the girl that used to be. 3 months later Andy was sitting on a hospital bed yelling at John while pulling him closer by the grip she had on his shirt, ""YOU ASSHOLE. YOU DID THIS TO ME."" ""You let me,"" John said with a smirk. ""Boy if I was you I""d wipe that smirk off your face before she kills you,"" the nurse said as she walked into the room. John laughed and said, ""I""d like to see her try."" Andy glared at John as another contraction seized her. ""Come on, it""s going to be alright,"" John said smiling as he rubbed her back. Mystique stood on the other side helping to cool her down with a wet rag. Mystique was currently in an old woman human form. She was posing as her mother at the moment so that she could be here. They didn""t allow mutants in this hospital, so she hoped her baby didn""t come out looking like one or they""d be screwed. The nurse looked under her gown and smiled, ""Your 10 centimeters exact. It""s time for you to start pushing dear."" ""Thank god,"" John said sighing.",806976

Chapter 10: Prepare for Battle The next day, all of the Guardians started sharpening their talon claws and their masks as they head for battle at St. Aggie""s. Travis was standing at the hollow, feeling a little anxious but confident that this is his first battle to go against Kludd and Nyra after some brutal memories after being at St. Aggie""s for a year and a half. He walks slowly and sees everyone prepping for war. ""You ready?"" Travis turned around and sees Soren, Twilight, Digger, Eglantine, Otulissa and Gylfie standing in front of them and Travis replied, ""As ready as I""ve ever been.""

I can""t take listening to your songs."" Digger said. ""Well, you""re gonna hear it anyway."" ""The only importance is that we can make strong the weak and mend the broken."" Soren said. ""Wasn""t there a third thing?"" asked Travis. ""And to vanquish evil."" ""That too."" Boron came over and asked, ""Are we all ready for this battle?"" ""Yes, sir. We are."" Soren replied. ""I""ve got your talons ready."" One by one, everyone got their talons ready and Travis looked his talon claws and it feels like he""s ready for this. Seeing that this is his first time there, he""s ready for anything. Otulissa looked at Travis"" talons and said, ""You know, for your first battle, I think you look amazing."" ""Thanks, I think."" Travis answered. ""Excellent! You seem fit for battle! Although, I""m pretty sure that all the warriors would fear you."" Twilight said. ""If they have, they""ll start with you."" Digger said. ""You should know.""",1276465
1176,"Elle exclaimed as they walked through the sweet-smelling streets. It was wet outside; it had rained. ""She was like, Oh, he can sleep in my room-"" he mimicked his mother""s voice with a high-pitched falsetto- ""And then bam! She squeezed my leg. She wants me, Elle, and it""s weird."" ""Oh, God, are you telling me your own mother was hitting on you?"" ""Yes! It""s creepy as hell, I know!"" He noticed her dress box. ""What""s in the box?"" ""Nothing you need to know about. Come on, I think I see 1640 up there."" A huge wooden mansion dominated the hillside, with a brick pathway leading up to it. Elle ran up to the mailbox and checked the number: 1640, right on the dot. She nodded at Marty, who ran up to the front door. He rapped his knuckles three times on the expensive-looking wood. ""Elle, are you sure about this?"" ""Positive. We""re at the right address, aren""t we?"" She was about to knock again but her knuckles fell forward as the door flew open. A visibly younger, less-silver haired Emmet Brown appeared in the doorway, a huge metal contraption strapped to his head. ""Doc-"" ""Don""t say a word,"" was all he said before pulling them inside. ""Doc-!"" ""I don""t want to know your name. I don""t want to know anything about you."" Doc crossed over to a metal cube with a myriad of different-colored switches and buttons. ""Doc, it""s us, it""s Elle and Marty-"" ""Don""t tell me anything. Quiet. Quiet!"" He stuck a blue, plunger-like thing to Elle""s forehead with a soft plop! Elle stared at him. ""Doc, what""re you-?"" Marty started. Doc ignored him. ""I""m going to read your thoughts. Let""s see now."" The machine hummed and smoked, with a couple of beeps thrown in. Elle stood there, absolutely bewildered. ""You come from a great distance?"" ""Yeah! Exactly!"" Elle exclaimed. ""We-"" ""Don""t tell me!"" Doc shushed her, and Elle fell silent. ""Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post?"" ""No!"" Elle said, all hopes of recognition fading from her voice. ""No, we-"" ""Not a word, not a word now!"" Doc reminded her impatiently. ""Uh..."" he clutched the metal hat, now blinking yellow and red. ""Donations! You want me to make a donation to Coast Guard Youth Auxiliary!"" ""Doc,"" Elle said, ripping the thing off her head. ""We""re from the future. We came here in a time machine that you invented."" Elle explained all of this as though she were speaking to a child. ""We need your help to get us back to the year 1985,"" she said slowly and clearly. Doc looked at her with slightly more reverance. He stepped forward and clutched her shoulders. ""Do you know what this means?"" Elle shook her head, confused. ""It means that this damn thing doesn""t work at all!"" he proclaimed, unbuckling the metal hat. Elle sighed in defeat. ""Doc, you gotta help us,"" Marty jumped in, following Doc into what looked like the living room. ""You are the only one who knows how your time machine works."" ""Time machine?"" Doc whispered, touching a bandage plastered to his temple. ""I haven""t invented any time machine."" Marty sighed. ""Okay, alright. I""ll prove it to you."" He reached in his pocket and pulled out his wallet.",2855986

3416,"""You guys? Is this the way to the lockers?"" Martin called. Eyes still closed, his hands still outstretched, he was wandering into the showers. ""Yeah, yeah, buddy. Just keep going straight,"" Cary snickered back. ""I hope we""re not playing dodgeball again,"" Joe said as he pulled on a gray shirt, wincing a bit at the memory. ""Nah, we""re not, they only make us play that once a week,"" Cary informed him, jumping in the air to pull his shorts on. Joe gaped at Cary. ""How do you know?"" ""Have you ever read the school rulebook?"" ""No, why would I?"" ""So if you ever get in trouble you can defend yourself with pure, solid fact,"" Cary explained matter-of-factly. ""Ah..."" ""I... hate... gym..."" Charles puffed ten minutes later as he jogged along the track. Today""s assignment: run three laps around the track (which was equivalent to a mile) in under fifteen minutes. Go over the set time limit, and the day""s work would result in an F. Unfortunately, Joe and Charles were horrendously unfit. Martin was even worse- he lagged about three yards away from them. ""Tell me... about it..."" Joe agreed, his body drenched in sweat. ""God, how does Cary do it?"" Cary finished his laps in six minutes and twenty-seven seconds. Small and wiry, he was the ideal runner- and often got practice from running from police when a firework landed on their car. ""Maybe... he""s on steroids..."" ""Yeah, probably..."" ""Hey, you guys!"" Alice said brightly, jogging past them. Her blonde hair was tied in a sloppy ponytail, but flyaways flew in the breeze nonetheless. She swiveled around and started running backwards to face them. ""Still on your second?"" ""Shut up,"" Joe grumbled. ""Friggin"" Cary is on his seventh, I think."" ""Wow,"" Alice said, impressed. ""I""m only my fourth."" ""How long has it been?"" Charles asked her. ""Er-"" she consulted her watch- ""ten minutes, seventeen seconds."" ""Shit! We""ve only got five minutes to get our third lap! Run, run!"" Charles yelped, sprinting ahead. Joe""s legs felt like lead. ""Charles, if we ever get an A, we""ll be dead!"" he shouted after him. ""No, I""ll be dead when my mom kills me for failing gym!"" Charles called. ""Alright, see ya in the morgue!"" Joe replied. """"Kay!"" Charles yelled back, flashing a thumbs-up sign. He disappeared amidst the other suffering, running kids. ""So, Joe,"" Alice said. ""So, Alice."" ""I think Cary""s officially been bitten by the lovebug."" Joe stopped in his tracks. ""With who?"" ""Elle,"" Alice said promptly. ""That girl in his math class?"" ""Yup."" When Joe had finally processed this information, he finally burst, ""What makes you think that?"" ""Look."" She pointed somewhere across the track. Squinting in the bright sunlight, he could just make out Cary walking with Elle, laughing with her. Light finally dawned on Joe. ""No wonder he wanted to finish his laps so early."" Cary looked particularly happy about something as they changed back into their clothes after class. He""d been surprisingly silent throughout the entire process, which was slightly worrying. ""Dude, is Cary sick or something?"" Charles muttered to Joe, who was buttoning up his shirt. ""Yeah.",2855986
3216,"""Oh I""m not going to drop this little one. Right my dear,"" Hakeem said as the little girl screamed in delight. ""Brother it is great to see that you are here,"" a voice called out. ""Oh Brother it is good to see you to. Look at how young Atiya has grown,"" Hakeem said with a laugh. ""Please Ardeth get you""re brother to stop this foolishness,"" Jamila""s mother begged as she watched Hakeem throw Jamila up in the air. ""Come now Hakeem no need to upset Adiva. You know how she is about you doing that,"" Ardeth laughed as he took Atiya from his brother""s arms. ""Uncle Ardeth,"" Jamila screamed wrapping her arms around his neck. ""Hello little one, and how are we,"" Ardeth asked. ""Look at the necklace me and mommy made,"" Jamila said laughing as she gave him the necklace. ""It""s beautiful, but who is it for,"" Ardeth asked knowing all to well. ""It""s for you silly,"" Jamila laughed. Ardeth smiled and took the necklace and wrapped it around his neck. ""How does it look,"" Ardeth asked. ""I think it looks pretty,"" Jamila squealed as Ardeth put her down. ""Yes I believe Atiya is right Ardeth. It does look good on you,"" Adiva, Jamila""s mother, said with a laugh, looking at the different colored, beaded necklace. ""Well I do believe..."" Hakeem was stopped in mid-sentence though as gunshots went off. ""Raiders,"" Ardeth and Hakeem hissed under their breath. ""Adiva take Atiya and hide in the main tent with the other mothers and children,"" Adiva nodded and picked Jamila up and ran with the other mothers and children toward the tent as the raiders descended upon the medji. Guns blew and knifes clanged as a war ranged around them. In the middle of the mess a raider knocked Adiva down. ""Well, well, well, what do we have here,"" the man asked evilly. ""Please don""t hurt my baby,"" Adiva cried out. ""Leave her alone,"" another voice cried as he flung himself at the man who was soon joined by others to help him. Suddenly a shot was fired and Jamila""s father fell to the ground with some red thick substance covering him. Then next she saw her mother being dragged off and shot as well. Before Jamila knew it she was in the arms of a foreign man and then on a horse galloping away from her uncle who ran after the man, but they never caught him. Jamila blacked out as the smell of smoke entered her lungs. When Jamila awoke she was in an orphanage with other children, and no one to tell her why. She just slowly forgot over time who she was as they gave her a whole new name and a family who adopted her changing her name as well to Alice Baker. She became an American child and she vowed she would come back to Egypt as she dreamed of her past life. Jamila snapped back out of her flashback and found she had already made her way to her black horse. She jumped up on it and then looked up at the clouds. There was nothing in sight at first until she squinted at the sky behind her. She didn""t need a scientist to tell her that an air balloon was following them, carrying not only the reincarnation of her past love, but also now her newly discovered uncle. How much messed up could her life get?",806976
1113,"Aurora looked up at her quizzically...her face seemed familiar. She wondered how on earth that girl had gotten in the bushes without anyone seeing. She""d been here longer than anyone else had. ""I""ve been growing an awful lot lately,"" the girl was telling the queen, ""I tower over everyone in Umbridge. I came here because I knew you""d understand..."" ""Of course, my dear girl. Anyone with a head as large as yours is welcome in my court."" She shouted at the servants to find some clothes for the giant girl. The crowd dispersed, muttering. Aurora ventured closer with a raised eyebrow. The girl had to squint to see what was written on the page in her book. Do I know you from somewhere, Um? I could swear I met you before. ""I""m sure you haven""t,"" the girl replied, ""do you know many giant people?"" Aurora held up one finger. So far, she""d only met one giant and that was Stayne. She wondered if he was having any luck finding the Alice person. ""You can""t talk, can you?"" I don""t have much to say...I don""t really think anyone cares what I have to say, though. I prefer to talk through my pictures. She held the book up. Um""s giant hands took the book and she flipped through it. ""These are really good."" She handed the book back to Aurora. I was hired on as the court artist. ""I can see why."" Umbridge must have been a lot like my world...people who are different aren""t well accepted there, either. Despite being as naked as a newborn, Aurora suspected Um of hiding something, but she chose not to ask. Martha came outside with the tape measure to get Um""s measurements. ""I""ll be right back, Um."" ""Thank you,"" Um said awkwardly. The little white rabbit with the watch stayed outside with them. He and Um spoke to each other as though they knew each other. The little mouse was also talking. They were discussing a man that was called ""Tarrant."" Aurora had not yet met him, but she thought she recognized the name. As soon as Martha brought out Um""s dress (a patchwork-like garment made of drapes and sheets), Aurora scribbled something in her book. I don""t know the guy personally, but I think I know where he is. The Queen was talking about a Mad Hatter upstairs...I""ve been meaning to go investigate anyway. ""Wonderful,"" Um sighed, ""would you take us up there?"" Aurora and the white rabbit led the way. She learned that his name was McTwisp and that the mouse was Mallympkin, Mally for short. The Hatter, Tarrant, was very happy to see Um again. Aurora watched the reunion and felt a slight pang in her heart. A pervasive sense of loneliness invaded her mind. She left after a moment. Stayne returned around lunchtime. He was not in a good mood. Aurora decided it might be a good idea to give him some space. She was working on Iracebeth""s latest demand for a portrait when he joined them in the throne room. He caught sight of Um and an unusual twinkle graced his eye. Aurora frowned. ""And who is this lovely creature?"" he whispered to Iracebeth. ""Um, my new favorite?"" He looked over at Alice. ""What is your name?"" ""Um,"" the queen replied impatiently.",870118

Maddy called as her bra was sent flying over the changing room door. Lily and Skye groaned and collapsed onto their chairs again. ""You said that an hour ago,"" Skye complained, kicking off her shoes and massaging her swollen ankles. ""Yeah, but I mean it this time. I have a really good feeling about his dress."" ""You said that an hour ago, too,"" Lily grumbled, resting her head back on the chair and closing her eyes. ""Don""t you go falling asleep on me now,"" Skye warned Lily, and her eyes instantly shot open. Evil Skye had convinced them to go dress shopping that day for the ball.",2855986
211,"My cohort shall appear in the strikes of your chain to weaken and halve all the statistics of the enemy...as well as lowering its defense by half..."" Dark Illusion spun a thread of energy in the air as it entwined in the weapon strung at Byakko""s side. [Received 6 Damnation Chain-1 ea] Byakko gazed at the demon as it slowly sucked into itself the void it has created. Slowly, light began to pierce the darkness and the demon retreated into the fissure he had created. ""Until next time...son of Sohee Mistress..."" Dark Illusion whispered. ""Yes...until next time..."" Byakko fell on his knees, weakened from the encounter as he slid the torn card into his pockets. The skull he kept clutching in his other as he finally realized that he was back at the Sanctuary. The people inside saw only a dark orb had encircled Byakko and the monster, and they were pretty sure that he would have been eaten by now, if not horribly dismembered in the most grueling way. The orb began to shrink and all that was left was a boy sprawled in the floor, his hands clutching a skull in his chest. ""Byakko!"" The cleric rushed from the pulpit to the kneeling boy in the center. The others stood back, in fear that the monster will return. Stretching his hand out to grasp the weakening acolyte, the cleric snapped back as he was thrown to the floor, a strange pentagram variation appearing on the floor where the acolyte was sprawled. It was some sort of evil Kyrie Eleison barrier. ""Holy Light!"" The cleric issued a blast of holy force as the barrier broke on it""s own accord. The priest finally had reached the boy, casting Status Recovery, Cure and Sanctuary around them. Byakko writhed in pain as the healing energy pulsated in the floor, but later fell weak and limply molded himself in the priest""s waiting arms. The skull fell from his grasp, bouncing once before finally halting in the crevice of the church floor. Everyone gasped as they saw the drop that Byakko had. No way he could""ve defeated the Dark Illusion, but this just proves he has! Still, it would""ve been best if... ""Everyone...gather around..."" The cleric called on his apprentices. ""I want all of you to never speak of this matter outside the church. I will not hesitate to silence all of you if need be. There should be no circulating news about what had happened this day."" The acolytes nodded, realizing that they would be denied priest hood if they had ever said word about it. ""Good."" The cleric looked at everyone. ""I assume all of you are very tired by now. Please, go back to your quarters and rest. We will resume training by tomorrow. That is all. ""The cleric made final word. After a short prayer, the hall cleared up of its residents, as the only persons left were the cleric and the resting acolyte in his arms. A priest came rushing forth from the doors of the Sanctuary, sweat lining his brows nit in stress and fear. His suspicions were well placed as he saw the silver-haired boy unconscious. ""Am I too late? How is the boy?"" The just-arrived priest asked the other. ""He is well, he had an encounter..."" ""From what?""",583064
3318,"Just then, she slipped. Yuuhi, being nearest to the door, caught her. It was so fast that both landed on each other and... Their lips met. A kiss brought about by a slip. Suzumi and Toya quickly helped Yuuhi and Aya. BLAG!! The sliding door that leads to the hallway shut violently. They were silent for a while. No one left the room so who could have closed it?

It was way pass midnight now. The once busy street was now deserted, except for the fact that a certain young man, with long hair, was walking down the road. ""Ashidori mou, Karukushite, chao, chao.."" he started to sing as droplets of rain fell from the sky. ""Argh! Why does it have to rain now that I don""t have any umbrella?!"" he muttered under his breath. He started to run when he noticed something. A girl with long hair was crossing the street, even though the green light was on. There was a truck speeding ahead. ""Watch out!!!"" the man pushed the girl out of the way and jumped to avoid the speeding truck. ""Hey! If you wanted to die, do it somewhere else!"" the driver shouted and sped away. ""Heck! What were you thinking! You almost got yourself killed! Idiot!"" the man approached the girl only to see that she was asleep. ""I can""t leave you here..."" he carried the girl and walked away.----------------------------------- ""Psst, who is that girl?"" ""I don""t know. My brother just brought her home last night."" ""Do you think she is his girlfriend?"" ""She is cute so why not?"" Chidori felt herself lying on a soft bed. Her eyelids were still heavy so she didn""t bother to open her eyes. She tried to remember what happened last night...waking up in her body again, rushing to see Yuuhi, Yuuhi kissing Aya, running away, being saved by a man when she was almost killed... She snapped her eyes open. She was surprised to see herself in an unfamiliar room. She examined the room with her eyes until she saw two people around. There was a young girl with short pink hair and an older man with black hair. ""Um...er...um...good morning?"" the young one said. Chidori sat up and smiled at her, ""Hello!"" ""She""s so cute..."" Chidori heard her say. The older one coughed and it caught Chidori""s attention. ""Um...hello!",560480
985,"Rei finally said, gently closing the door to his room. Yuuya gaped for a while before taking his bearings and returning to his room (conveniently across Rei""s). Rei""s door slid open. ""...And you""re welcome."" And it slid shut once more. Leaving Yuuya to smile a bit, fiddling with his assignment before finally hitting for the night. 0.o Oh dear...the episodes are getting on me.

(cackles evilly) Flack: Sigh...the things I do for love (runs and gets a bonk on the head for sighing) Chapter 4 Saturday afternoon ""C""mon Yuuya, we have to shop before night falls."" Rei impatiently called from the outside, his voice directing at an open window above their house. ""M""here."" Yuuya replied, shuffling from the door. Rei noticed the other""s new polo. ""Since when did you start wearing that?"" Rei pointed at the crisp, white polo Yuuya wore. ""Huh? This one? Auntie gave it to me last night...why?"" Yuuya shifted his head in askance. ""...It""s originally mine."" Rei crossed his arms, sitting himself on the leather seat of their scooter. And mind you, it doesn""t look half-bad on yourself... ""Uh? Really? S...sorry. I thought it was your old polo or anything...I""ll go change to something else."" Yuuya mildly panicked, Rei noticing the hint of sadness and disappointment. ""Hn, never mind. You""re right...it""s old.",583064
1450,"Jamila shut her eyes again and groaned, ""Of all the things to bring me down and it was a book."" Imhotep laughed at her words and slowly stood. ""Well now that you are awake and well. I believe I will leave so that you can continue doing what you were doing before you fell,"" he said handing her the book she had been trying to reach. ""Thank you father,"" Jamila said without realizing her words sooner. Imhotep""s eyes widen and his head jerked toward her. It took a few minutes for Jamila to register what she said and when she did she looked up at him and said, ""Sorry it slipped."" Imhotep""s eyes went soft and he smiled, ""I do not mind. I have always thought of you as my daughter anyway, and besides if I am with your mother then that only means I am your step father anyway."" Jamila smiled and nodded. ""I""ll leave now. I must go see how you""re mother is doing with the child,"" Imhotep said still speaking in English and still surprising Jamila. Jamila nodded and he slowly left out the sliding door. He slid it shut and left her to her own business. Jamila opened the book and turned to the page she remembered in her dream, or more so, her memory. Her memory had been right about all that had happened. As she read the pages the blank spots in her memory were slowly forming. The only question now was, could Alex O""Connell really be Amun reincarnated, and if so why should it matter so much to her now? Guess what? I""M BACK. Yep I""m back for now peoples. I heard about the new movie for the Mummy coming out and decided I might as well try my hand at this story again. I don""t know how long my inspiration will last, but hope and pray for me that it will last a while. I got some new and good ideas for this story since I have forgotten the old ones, so it might be a little off, but hey at least I""m writing again right. I hope you like it though as I create it and I hoped you loved this chapter. I""d like to thank my loyal readers and the reviewers for giving me inspiration to write this again, I only hope that you keep giving me inspiration and the strength to go on. PLEASE REVIEW NO FLAMES +Dreaming Memories + Alex sat farthest from the others on the air balloon. He had a lot on his mind to think about, and he didn""t want to have people bothering him constantly, like his mother. Ever since he saw that girl he couldn""t help but feel like she was familiar to him. He felt drawn to her and couldn""t help, but feel bad as he fought her, or whenever someone else hurt her. It was like some inner voice was telling him not to hurt her; like that inner voice had feelings for her. Alex shook his head. It was impossible for him to like her with what she had done, plus he barely knew her. Yet he was still drawn to her. He slowly closed his eyes to rest his mind and felt himself drift off to sleep slowly. Alex stood facing his opponent cautiously. His opponent who resembled Jamila or more so was the ancient Egyptian princess Jamila in a training outfit. This Jamila had black hair and gold braids in it.",806976
