# Daan Brugmans Radboud University Archive
This repository serves as a public archive for all the assignments and projects I have done for all of the courses I have taken at the [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/en).
It is an archive both in the sense that it is here in order to preserve the work I have done and in the sense that it should be displayed to all those who wish to take a look at what I have made.
If you came here wanting to know about what kind of work I have done, I invite you to explore this repository.
The folders you see here are courses I have taken at the Radboud University, mostly for my [Data Science Master](https://www.ru.nl/en/education/masters/data-science).
Every folder should contain a README on its own that will tell you more about that course in particular.

## A Note on Private Works
This repository does not contain all work I have done for the Radboud University.
Due to licenses bound to some of my work, I cannot publish them here.
I will show what I am allowed to.
This also means that I very much intend to exclude work that is bound to a non-open source license, such as material produced by the Radboud University.
**If you find any work, products, or else in this repository that does not belong to me, please, message me!** I would appreciate it :)
