# Data Mining Research
Repository for the Data Mining Research Project, a part of the RU Data Science Pre-Master, made by [@daanbrugmans](https://github.com/daanbrugmans) and [@JosseNobel](https://github.com/JosseNobel).

This repository contains the code written for the class project for the course [Data Mining](https://www.ru.nl/courseguides/socsci/courses-osiris/ai/nwi-ibi008-data-mining/), 
a second-year course from the [Computing Science bachelor](https://www.ru.nl/en/education/bachelors/computing-science) of the [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/en).

## Project Goal
The goal of the class project was to analyze a data set with a corresponding problem, train multiple machine learning models on the preprocessed data set and report the findings in a research report. Our data set is a subset of the [BRFSS](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/index.html) (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System) 2015 survey, a yearly survey conducted by the CDC collect health-related data about U.S. citizens. Our corresponding problem was to train machine learning models to predict a U.S. citizen's likelihood of developing a cardiovascular disease based on their lifestyle factors.

## Code
The preprocessing code, alongside the code for plotting data for data analysis purposes, are provided in the [Preprocessing.R](Preprocessing.R) and [Plots.R](Plots.R) files respectfully. The code for the different machine learning models may be found in the [Models](Models) folder. The data analyzed may be found in the [Data](Data) folder. Finally, the [Images](Images) folder contain .png files for all plots that may be generated using the [Plots.R](Plots.R) file.

## Paper
A paper about the findings of our research may be found in the [Data Mining Research.pdf](Data_Mining_Research.pdf) folder.
